Therefore, this study aims to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) can strengthen college students' environmental awareness and encourage them to make a move on environmental issues. Four hundred college students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds participated in a six-month study, and 375 valid questionnaires were successfully collected. By combining AI and VR, we provided interactive and engaging courses to deliver knowledge about environmental issues and inevitable disasters. The research demonstrates that using AI and VR technologies to teach environmental challenges can significantly improve college students' understanding of these topics, assist them in developing a conservationist value system, and provoke them to carry on environmental advocacy. This study adopted scale items to measure college students' environmental awareness and activities. More isolated structural equation modeling validated the value of AI and VR in environmental education. Additionally, mediation and moderation analyses indicated that the strength of college students' ecological susceptibility and motivation indirectly influenced their enthusiasm and environmental awareness through AI and VR. Through comparative analysis, we found that AI and VR exert differential effects on college students. Further correlational and regression analyses demonstrated that raising college students' environmental awareness can effectively promote their pro-environmental behavior, offering them more critical agency, possibly without the need for continued use of AI and VR. Therefore, employing AI and VR in environmental education may effectively help young people in ecological sustainability. Ultimately, we discussed the current AI and VR technologies adoption in Chinese universities and proposed relevant policy implications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176325746"

This pandemic has engulfed “man, machine, and material” and paralyzed them for an indefinite time. Furthermore, the pandemic has resulted in an uncertainty in the operation and management of industries relying on “man, machine, and material.” Though the past reflection of the hospitality industry has been termed as the “sunshine” industry, the COVID-19 pandemic has turned it entirely into a “state of cloudiness.” This people-intensive still embrace its patrons with folded hands inspired by the true essence and value of hospitality, but with a new design and protocol triggered by various technological innovations. To mitigate the spread of this deadly disease, “social distancing” has been the new norm of the hospitality business and its existence heavily depends on the mantra of “contactless” and “touchless.” There is no exception to the hospitality industry, where contactless and touchless operations have been the new standard operating procedures (SOPs). Although these SOPs for the hospitality industry may seem to be “gloomy” and “spiritless,” but for the sake of the bread and butter of employees and the safety of guests and employees, these are essential and bare needs of this hour. It is therefore 382imperative that hotels embrace a proactive approach to this paradigm change for sustainability in the post-COVID-19 period. This may focus on assimilating various technological and digital approaches, such as artificial intelligence, big data analytics, the Internet of things, 5G network, augmented reality, virtual reality, and robotics for fulfilling the guest service delivery and experience through contactless hospitality. © 2024 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176825539"

This review study provides a comprehensive overview of stakeholder analysis in this context, highlighting gaps in current research and paving the way for future investigations. For this purpose, scientific literature and critical analysis are conducted based on identified relevant research works to map the mutual role of stakeholders in this context. This study categorises cutting-edge technologies into four groups - virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and digital twin - and explores their adoption in engaging various stakeholders across the five key stages of risk management: prevention, mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery. Results show that existing research has primarily concentrated on the support to water utilities and the communication with the general public. However, there is a noticeable gap in research regarding the comprehensive engagement of important stakeholders such as policy-makers, researchers, and insurance providers. Furthermore, the study highlights disparities in the involvement of stakeholders in damage assessment studies, particularly with a lack of representation from policy-makers and researchers.

In VR science laboratory simulations, do students follow typical safety and behavior norms or do they engage largely in “non-lesson related” behaviors [2]? In addition, VR is touted for increasing student interest and motivation in subjects but how exactly does this happen in these environments? We observed seventy-six 11–18 yr.-olds (N = 76) conduct a chemistry experiment in a VR lab simulation. Observations focused on lab safety behaviors and behaviors typically not exhibited in real-life situations (novel). Results showed that &gt; 75% of students still follow basic safety rules but only 49% conducted cleaning behaviors in VR. Novel behaviors were observed in 51% of the participants. Behaviors most observed were moving around the room with no obvious intent, throwing objects or breaking glassware, and playing with lab equipment. We argue that the existence of these behaviors can be viewed as students expressing their curiosities, an important step in encouraging STEM pursuits. The freedom to engage in this behavior is a clue to the motivational affordances VR can provide.

It is the technical link between the material world and the virtual world. The realization of face-to-face psychological diagnosis with three-dimensional holography is a difficult problem in meta-cosmic medicine. Because psychological diagnosis needs to observe rapidly changing microexpressions, it is difficult to capture them. At present, most of the research is based on two dimensions, which cannot meet the real-time reconstruction requirements of meta-universe medicine. To solve these problems, this paper introduces a 3D facial reconstruction algorithm composed of multiresolution feature fusion and attention mechanisms. It can be used for psychological assistant diagnosis of meta-cosmic medicine. First, face alignment and 3D coordinate construction of the feature point cloud are carried out through a 3D convolution coding network. After that, multiresolution cost convolution is used to extract and match the color, facial bones, and depth features of texture images. Finally, the transposed three-dimensional convolution is used to decode and output. To achieve the real-time reconstruction of psychotherapy, we designed a three-dimensional channel attention mechanism module for acceleration. This makes this method suitable for the construction of virtual doctors and virtual patients in the virtual platform of the medical universe of psychological medicine and can also complete the construction of the virtual teaching platform of the medical universe. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176264707"

This is based on the concept of hormesis, which postulates a strengthening effect of stress at low-to-moderate doses. Leveraging this approach, hormetic curves indicate under which stress dose an individual is able to maintain or even increase goal-directed behavior. The present study aimed to test the hormetic effect of low-to-moderate stress on tactical movement performance in the context of police operational scenarios in virtual reality. In teams of three to four, 37 riot police officers had to search a building for a potentially aggressive perpetrator in three scenarios with escalating stress potential (i.e., increasing weapon violence and number of civilians). Tactical movement performance as behavioral response was quantified by the sample entropy of each officer's velocity derived from positional data. To account for inter-individuality in response to the scenarios, we assessed self-reported stress, anxiety, mental effort, and vagally mediated heart rate variability. Specifically, we tested the quadratic associations between tactical movement performance and stress parameters, respectively. Random-intercept-random-slope regressions revealed neither significant linear nor quadratic associations between any of the stress parameters and performance. While we did not find evidence for hormesis in the present study, it stimulates theoretical discussions about the definition of “baseline” functioning and how the understanding of hormesis can move from psychological to behavioral adaptations to stressors. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175582295"

Throughout the development cycle, a variety of user-centered learning experience design methods and process were employed. To assess the usability and user experience of Project PHoENIX, a formative evaluation with multiple usability sessions was conducted across two phases: Phase I Usability Testing and Phase II Pilot Testing.

This paper discusses the significance of different terrain visualization techniques with a special emphasis on 3D visualization. How 3D terrain visualization is useful in photogrammetry, LiDAR, and aerial imagery, maps can generate detailed models of terrains, buildings, and objects. These techniques enable users to explore geographic features from various angles, zoom in for detailed analysis, and even simulate virtual environments. The applications of 3D maps are diverse and far-reaching. In virtual reality, they can create immersive environments for training, simulations, and gaming. In remote sensing, they aid in understanding natural resources, urban planning, and disaster management. In scientific visualization, they enable researchers to analyze complex spatial data and model real-world phenomena. In GIS, 3D maps enhance spatial analysis, decision-making, and communication of geospatial information. In conclusion, the evolution of 3D maps in GIS has revolutionized how geographic information is visualized and analyzed, with potential applications in various domains.

Therefore, there are many methods in the literature to determine the effective atomic number theoretically or experimentally. While theoretical methods neglect some parameters, such as the momentum transfer parameter, photon energy, or scattering angle, experimental methods have incommodious processes. The main goal of this study is to provide a practical simulation method that is both as realistic as experimental results and as easy as theoretical methods. The method considers all these parameters compared to other theoretical methods and transfers them to the virtual environment. In this study, Rayleigh and Compton scattering peaks of 60 pure elements (in the range 20< Z <80) were determined. Rayleigh and Compton peak ratios were correlated with their atomic numbers. The proposed method is available for any energy or scattering angle. Six different compounds (WC, W65Cu35, SnAg, Fe54Co17Ni29, Pd94Cr6, Cu60Zn40) were selected from different atomic number regions (such as low, medium, and high regions). It is important to note that any material (compound or mixture) could be selected. Validation of the method has been performed via different methods commonly used in the literature.

The area is rich in heritage, with unique archaeological sites accompanied by artefacts, stories, poems, and songs about local legends or contemporary accounts of past events. Many are available in English, but are at their most expressive and authentic in the original Gaelic. Currently, there is a crisis in the vernacular community; decade-on-decade reductions in the numbers of people using Gaelic in their day-to-day lives presents an urgent problem for the community. The recent revolution in the way that digital technologies are being used offers innovative opportunities to preserve the ‘Cultural Landscape’, to make it more widely available, and indeed to contribute to its development. Capturing this requires the representation of the landscape that provides the setting for North Uist’s heritage. Emergent immersive and mobile technologies offer the possibility of integrating digital representations of these elements into the Gaelic medium, with the goal of capturing vernacular interpretation of Uist heritage, ensuring that Gaelic expression is part of emergent media and that the transmission of heritage and language is authentic. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176951701"

Serious games can help make learning about history more engaging. Students can directly experience situations of the past as well as interact and communicate with agents representing people of the respective era. This allows for situated learning. Besides using computer screens, the gameplay can also be experienced using immersive Virtual Reality (VR). VR adds an additional spatial level and can further increase the engagement as well as vividness. To investigate the benefits of using VR for serious games targeting the learning of history, we developed a serious game for desktop-3D and VR. Our serious game puts a player into the role of a medieval miller’s apprentice. Following a situated learning approach, the learner operates a mill and interacts with several other characters. These agents discuss relevant facts of the medieval life, thus enabling the construction of knowledge about the life in medieval towns. An evaluation showed that the game in general was successful in increasing the user’s knowledge about the covered topics as well as their topic interest in history. Whether the immersive VR or the simple desktop version of the application was used did not have any influence on these results. Additional feedback was gathered to improve the game further in the future. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176916824"

To overcome these limitations, robots can be trained in virtual environments using Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, this approach faces a significant challenge in obtaining suitable data. This paper proposes a novel method for training collaborative robots in virtual environments using synthetic data and the point cloud framework. The proposed method is divided into four stages: data generation, 3D object classification, robot training, and integration. The first stage of the proposed method is data generation, where synthetic data is generated to resemble real-world scenarios. This data is then used to train robots in virtual environments. The second stage is 3D object classification, where the generated data is used to classify objects in 3D space. In the third stage, robots are trained using RL algorithms, which are based on the generated data and the 3D object classifications. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is integrated in the fourth stage. This proposed method has the potential to be a significant contribution to the field of robotics and 3D computer vision. By using synthetic data and the point cloud framework, the proposed method offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for training robots in virtual environments.

In the last few decades, the use of e-books to visualize documents has become prevalent. However, transferring an original document designed to be printed requires extraction of the document’s logical structure. The document must be broken down into fragments of text and images with the extraction of its logical structure. The fragments are then recomposed together to be presented as an e-book. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm where documents can be presented in their original form without the need to be physically restructured, thanks to VR. With a VR headset, the proposed document visualizer allows users to access, display, and annotate documents.

However, its beam quality under high power tends to be serious degradation and become annular hollow distribution, severely limiting the use of VCSEL. Here, the anisotropic elliptical oxide aperture VCSEL (AEOA-VCSEL) was designed to achieve high-power Gaussian beam with high-quality via anisotropic modes control. The saturation output power reached up to 8.2 mW under low injection current, to our best knowledge, which was the highest power generated in single VCSEL device. Moreover, the AEOA-VCSEL can control the output beam profile only by adjusting injection current, and could also homogenize the mode spacing among adjacent high-order modes.

It affects students’ learning outcomes and is different for novice and experienced teachers. However, teaching classroom management, especially for specialized subjects like computer science where specific equipment is necessary, can be challenging. Moreover, it is difficult to provide real-life training opportunities as lessons cannot be repeated and experimentation time is very limited. This is particularly problematic for novice teachers and teacher students. To address this and support this issue, virtual reality and immersive learning can be used to simulate classroom scenarios and provide (data-driven and personal) feedback to pre-service teachers.

This research implemented a methodology for the rapid impulse response generation using the position of a moving listener inside a fixed sound field. The rapid generation of the impulse response is performed using its representative compressed dimension, with a smaller dimension than the original impulse response, learned by variational autoencoders and long short-term memory neural networks. First, the methodology selects a representative number of impulse responses covering the area of interest using a reliable room acoustic simulator. Second, it generates a dataset with sufficient impulse responses uniformly distributed through a data augmentation approach using a modified bilinear interpolation from the impulse responses previously simulated. Third, it applies an unsupervised model to positionally cluster the impulse responses to reduce the variability of the impulse responses in the given environment. Fourth, it splits the impulse response into time segments and generates a dataset per segment and cluster. Fifth, it trains a variational autocoder with a long short-term memory neural network model for each time segment cluster of impulse responses to infer the correspondent compressed impulse response part. In summary, the impulse response is generated by assigning the current listener position to the corresponding cluster and executing the decoders of the variational autoencoders with long short-term memory, trained previously. The findings are encouraging; the normalized mean absolute error of the impulse responses gathered by the interpolator and the impulse responses generated by the proposed model is less than 15% in the 88% of impulse responses reserved for testing. Moreover, the average of the absolute error of the interaural cross-correlation coefficient between the impulse responses obtained from the simulator and the proposed model is around 16%, implying that most acoustic characteristics of the real impulse are preserved. In addition, the computational time for generating the impulse response segment of 300 ms is approximately 65 ms, which is almost haft than the total system latency for a realistic auralization, 112 ms. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177620901"

The combination of computer aided design (CAD) and virtual reality (VR) technology provides new opportunities for enterprises. In order to explore the influence of brand marketing strategy of CAD products based on VR on consumers' purchase intention, this article puts forward a prediction model of consumers' purchase intention based on user data mining (DM). By comparing the F1 value of this algorithm and ID3 algorithm in the task of predicting consumers' purchase intention, it is found that this algorithm has higher F1 value and stability. This proves the effectiveness and superiority of the consumer purchase intention prediction model based on user DM.

We provide a systematic review and discuss specific cases in which results were not as expected. Factors that adversely affect learning include novelty effects, VR sickness, low interaction fidelity, cognitive overload, or other environmental or classroom factors.

In the process of using local maximum of wavelet modulus, aiming at the selection of local maximum, the modulus maximum is calculated along the gradient direction. The results show that the WT algorithm in this article shows high efficiency in optimizing packaging images.

The exploration of steganography using mocap data is still limited despite its wide-range of potential practical applications. Compared to image, audio, and video steganography, the challenges in mocap steganography arise from differences between the temporal lengths and topologies of the cover and secret data, non-zero residuals between mocap data sequences, non-repetitive movements in different chunks of the mocap data. Deep neural network (DNN) based hiding models could be a potential solution to address these challenges in mocap steganography. DNN-based steganography has been adopted in many recent works and has shown promising results in steganographic techniques in various domains, including image, audio and video; however, to date, no prior work has investigated the application of DNN models for hiding mocap data. In this paper, we investigate solutions to deal with the challenges in mocap steganography and propose a novel end-to-end deep neural network model, DSteganoM, to hide a sequence of skeletal motions into another. The proposed model is capable of learning and exploring the redundancy of spatial and temporal Euclidean positional information in each skeletal motion for the hiding task. In addition, by introducing upsampling and pooling mechanisms in our network architecture, the DSteganoM model also can hide mocap data of different topologies with different dimensions. Experimental results show that the proposed DSteganoM model outperforms other state-of-the-art models and can visually reconstruct the cover and secret with high resistance to signal perturbation. Our work bridges the research gap in applying deep steganography to address the challenges in mocap data hiding. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173903213"

Most studies of VR in education and training, however, have focused on the hardware by comparing learning with VR to other devices in controlled lab experiments. This “black box” approach does not attend to variation beyond the device, such as how learners use an application and the influence of their identity and context on their learning with VR. This study addressed the need for more research on learning with VR in authentic workforce development contexts to better understand how diverse participants use these programs and to what extent their individual characteristics impact their experience. Using data from 1,154 users of a VR-enabled job interview training for individuals affected by the criminal justice system, we assessed variation in how participants used the program and their reported changes in confidence, and estimated associations with device, usage, and learners’ characteristics. We find learners’ experience and context is a stronger predictor of increased confidence level than device or usage activities, particularly whether participants are currently or formerly incarcerated. Further, we demonstrate how cluster analysis on log-file data can distinguish learners’ use patterns, a promising method for personalizing feedback and training. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176918507"

The features of architectural images are extracted and analyzed by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to optimize the 3D modeling process, and then the restoration of buildings and scenes based on CAD and VR is realized. In this algorithm, CNN is used to extract and analyze the features of architectural images, so as to optimize the 3D modeling process. The results show that the building image recognition algorithm based on multi-feature fusion has higher accuracy and running efficiency than the contrast algorithm. Moreover, the algorithm in this article has good stability and generalization ability, and can adapt to the needs of different architectural scenes. © 2024 U-turn Press LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176575349"

Since multisensory stimulation can enhance the sense of presence in a virtual environment, the present study compared virtual reality exposure with and without vibrotactile cues to determine its contribution to the realism of the virtual experience. Methods: A repeated measures design was used. Thirty-one participants were exposed to two experimental conditions with a minimum of a one-week interval between them: one in which participants were exposed to the virtual environment with vibrotactile cues (smart chair, SC), and another in which participants were exposed to the virtual environment without vibrotactile cues (ordinary chair, OC). The administration order of both conditions was counterbalanced to avoid possible order effects. Results: Participants felt higher levels of sense of presence when using the SC than the OC. However, the addition of vibrotactile stimulation partially influenced experienced anxiety. Some personality traits were also associated with participants’ sense of presence and anxiety responses during the exposure. Limitations: The sample size was smaller than required. Moreover, only self-reported measures were used. Finally, a roller coaster instead of an airplane scenario was used for the exposure, which might not have been suitable enough for provoking anxiety in participants with FoF. Conclusions: Vibrotactile cues enhanced the sense of presence. However, the addition of vibrotactile stimulation did not have a consistent effect on anxiety experienced during exposure. Therefore, the benefits of incorporating vibrotactile cues in virtual reality environments for exposure therapy are not clear. © 2023 The Authors","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174168590"

This article describes the historical and theoretical foundations for the formation of scenery. The result of the analysis is a historical scale that clearly shows the evolution of decorative art in connection with the architecture of theatrical structures and design features. The authors identified 3 main stages in the development of scenery. This process was directly related to the change in the space of the theater itself and its technical arrangement. The first stage covers the period from the Ancient World to the Middle Ages. The second stage is associated with the appearance of theater architecture in classical modern typology before the advent of cinema. The third stage is connected with the division of decorative art into the areas of theater and cinema and before the replacement of physical scenery with special effects.

Manual segmentation, as the gold standard, is tedious, time consuming, and particularly challenging for the mandible, while artificial intelligence (AI)-based segmentation is a promising and time-saving alternative. However, little is known about the clinical implications of various segmentation methods. Method: In this cross-over study, ten mandibles were segmented in virtual reality (VR), on a desktop screen (DS) by five experts and via five AI models. The exported mandible models were evaluated using metrics, a public reference (PUBDS), and blinded assessments by two radiologists. Results: Average segmentation-to-volume accuracy (1 = poor, 5 = perfect) was comparable for human segmentation (VR: 4.56; DS: 4.33; PUBDS: 4.55) and significant better than AI-based segmentation (AI: 3.80), while the average segmentation-to-segmentation accuracy revealed that DS (91.4 %/0.37 mm [Dice coefficient/average Hausdorff distance]) was more comparable to PUBDS than to VR (90.1 %/0.44 mm). The precision of VR (96.8 %/0.14 mm) and DS (96.6 %/0.15 mm) was superior to PUBDS (94.1 %/0.21 mm) and the AI method (89.2 %/0.60 mm). While VR was significantly faster than DS and PUBDS for the manual segmentation methods (p = 0.007/< 0.001), in contrast, the AI method is not time sensitive due to its possible hardware scalability. Conclusion: Accuracy and precision of mandible segmentation depends primarily on CT quality and anatomical site, which should be considered in clinical applications and the generation of AI training data and could negatively impact CAS. Although current AI models have perfect intra-model reliability, they demonstrate higher inter-model variability and are accompanied by invalid outliers making human review still necessary. In summary, the use of VR in manual segmentation showed high accuracy and precision overall while saving time, making it the preferred method over DS due to its good usability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176304182"

Consequently, industrial robots have to frequently use motion planning schemes pre-programmed by operators. Furthermore, traditional robot teaching methods in the human-robot interaction scenario can only be applied in a fixed task environment and therefore lack generalization ability. To address these shortcomings, this research proposes an augmented reality-assisted interaction approach using deep reinforcement learning and cloud-edge orchestration for user-friendly robot teaching. Firstly, the proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm with the position prediction function is applied for the robot motion planning, which can avoid unnecessary collision attempts during the training process. Subsequently, augmented reality glasses provide a user-friendly interaction interface, allowing both virtual and physical robots to be operated to eliminate the limitations of spatial and human factors. Apart from this, the robot target positions can be set by operators, and the visible trajectory of the calculated path can be integrated into the real scenario by virtue of AR glasses. On top of this, the cloud-edge orchestration links the communication between the industrial AR cloud platform and the edge nodes (e.g., robots and augmented reality glasses). Ultimately, comparative numerical experiments are conducted in an actual machining workshop, and the results indicate that the proposed robot teaching approach is both efficient and applicative by virtue of deep reinforcement learning and cloud-edge orchestration. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170099048"

Therefore, it is important to teach this topic to future developers of the said systems. As accessibility can be hard to grasp due to one’s inability to experience the problematic barriers people with disabilities face, Virtual Reality (VR) comes into play. VR technology offers the opportunity to simulate situations encountered by persons with disabilities and enables the possibility of new experiences. To further analyze the suitability of a VR application to teach accessibility, we developed Access to Escape, an Immersive Game-Based Learning Experience for Accessibility Education in Virtual Reality. A first evaluation with 11 participants could show that the VR Escape Room helped to develop a different perspective through the simulated limitation of their senses and sensitize them to the issue of accessibility. The participants reported that they have discovered new connections concerning accessibility. Furthermore, the use of VR was perceived as very enjoyable, especially due to the increase of motivation and the simplification of the topic. Besides that, the results of the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) could show that the participants perceived the VR Escape Room as attractive, stimulating and novel. The evaluation demonstrates that a Game-Based Learning Experience in a virtual environment might lead to cognitive as well as affective learning outcomes. The use of the VR Escape Room in education has the potential to improve learning, especially to raise awareness of accessibility. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176961716"

The solution to effective mitigation of dust exposure depends not only on higher-order engineering controls, but also on administrative controls for frontline workers. However, there is a disconnect between knowledge gathered in the field of dust exposure monitoring and the frontline worker, resulting in important learnings being overlooked in underground tunnelling operations. To remedy this discrepancy, an immersive educational tool was developed to visualise computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling datasets of ventilation and respirable dust flow characteristics in the tunnel face in a virtual reality (VR) environment. An algorithm was developed for processing the large and complex CFD datasets into a form that can be processed and visualised using standalone VR headsets with limited processing power. The VR-CFD system was assessed by an industry expert and via many industry showcases, where regular feedback was received for making significant improvements in this education tool. This tool has been developed as a training platform to allow frontline workers to better understand the results of decisions made during tunnelling operations and the best practices for dust controls. A number of key technological achievements were made that can be used in the future to quickly translate real-world particulate readings collected from underground space into a VR visualiser. This VR-CFD digital technology can readily be extended to mining, construction and other tunnelling operations in the underground space, thus improving health and safety. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176253288"

Minecraft, a popular sandbox game, has a great potential to become a virtual reality platform for building immersive environments. Traditional methods of building virtual reality scenes rely heavily on massive human labors and require high levels of proficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an automatic, voxelated 3D modeling method with foreground and background environment segmented that can reduce modeling costs and achieve effective application in Minecraft virtual reality scenes such as virtual campuses. The proposed method leverages the use of point cloud reconstruction using a voxelization approach. A pipeline of converting point cloud to Minecraft scene is developed. Through preprocessing, segmenting, coloring, and exporting, a Minecraft virtual reality scene can be automatically generated based on voxel point cloud. Due to the noise in point cloud may cause defect during voxelization, a denoising and smoothing method using slice scanning and voxel connectivity segmentation has been implemented. It can generate building structures with clear outlines and uniform colors. And the entire process requires low computational complexity and achieves fast generation. We conducted experiments based on this method in indoor scenes, outdoor building landmarks, and complex underground scenes, and obtained results with clear structures and smooth surfaces, saving a lot of time for subsequent detailed modeling. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176953802"

Existing methods only focus on either reconstructing the human body geometry or relighting the human body under specific poses and cannot accommodate new poses in fusion-relighting images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enables the relighting of new poses from multiview human videos under unknown illumination, whereby a relationship is established between the observation space and canonical space through a pose-mapping process that connects the geometry and reflectance at different temporal and spatial locations. The geometry and reflectance results obtained from the neural fields are input into the physically based renderer along with the optimized environment map. Human relighting in new poses can be generated by inputting skeletal poses, and the entire pipeline can be trained in a self-supervised manner. The proposed technique was verified on multiple datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of fulfilling the goal of a virtual lighting environment and real human fusion under new human poses, outperforming recent methods both subjectively and quantitatively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174963667"

Brain-computer interface technology can be used for the treatment of post-stroke patients by extracting signals from the brain’s neural activity through special equipment and converting this signal into commands that can be recognized by a computer. OBJECTIVE: To analyze and summarize the application of brain-computer interface technology in the upper limb motor function rehabilitation of stroke patients in recent years and to explore the clinical value of brain-computer interface technology in the upper limb function rehabilitation of stroke patients. METHODS: CNKI and PubMed were retrieved for relevant literature published from 2000 to 2022. The keywords were “stroke, electroencephalogram, brain-computer interface, upper limb, virtual reality technology, functional electrical stimulation, exoskeleton” in Chinese and “stroke, brain-computer interface, computer assistance, upper limb, virtual reality technology, functional electrical stimulation, exoskeleton” in English. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The brain-computer interface has shown promise for the restoration of upper limb motor function in stroke patients and has been shown to produce results that are unattainable with conventional treatments, and is well worth further research and promotion, but the mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Also the ability to accurately decode all degrees of freedom of upper limb movements to provide flexible and natural control remains a challenge from the perspective of brain-computer interface systems that capture electroencephalogram signals from patients. Future research should focus on clarifying the specific neural mechanisms by which brain-computer interface technology facilitates upper limb motor recovery after stroke and identifying rehabilitation options such as brain-computer interfaces combined with external devices to facilitate upper limb motor function recovery in stroke patients. © 2024, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

In order to promote the use of computer aided design (CAD) technology in ceramic design and assist the structural analysis and design optimization of ceramic products, this article proposes a 3D scene simplification algorithm of virtual reality (VR) based on photon mapping algorithm. The test and analysis of the algorithm show that the algorithm can be applied to the simplification of 3D model of ceramic design and some real-time interactive systems. With the support of VR, ceramic products can be browsed in all directions, scenes can be roamed and information can be exchanged. This not only provides convenience for the structural analysis and design of ceramic products, but also avoids the drawback that the traditional physical display method is not harmonious with the vulnerability characteristics of ceramic products. © 2024 U-turn Press LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176562182"

The survey comprises an anthropometric investigation of 106 students of a university and an investigation of design students who use DHM. The study examines the design students apply DHM and product design to design scenes. The survey results show that the students’ design works can be divided into three types: (A) adjusting 3D human models (61.3%), (B) no adjusting 3D human models (23.6%), and (C) no importing 3D models (i.e., only cut-paste human shape images; 15.1%). Most of the students are able to use the low design threshold approach to generate good design works. In addition, the case study focuses on the students’ design works of door handle devices in public places during the COVID-19 epidemic. The results show that the simulated sensory feedback the virtual environment gives to the students lacks sufficient accuracy. Although designers could simulate the user’s operation in the early design stage, however, applying DHMs does not ensure the generation of optimal designs. In product design experiments, physical prototypes are needed to simulate the user’s working force, to which the optimal angles and shapes can be determined. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177170373"

Traditional optoelectronic measurement systems consist of a large number of components, and a significant amount of time is spent on preliminary system calibration. In this article, a method of visual servo control using a FishEye camera and structured light is proposed to optimize the tube center position. The proposed technical vision system contains fewer elements, simplifying the system configuration and setup. Firstly, the optical axis of the technical vision system is aligned with the inner surface axis of the tube through calibration. Then, laser points belonging to the inner surface of the tube are extracted. Next, a visual servo control law is applied to control the deviation between the desired and current positions of the tube center. Finally, experiments are conducted in a developed virtual environment that replicates the real technological process to demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method. Real-world experiments involve measurement uncertainties, making it challenging to compare different methods. Additionally, it is difficult or impossible to estimate certain parameters in real conditions. The virtual environment helps overcome these issues.

This method adopts VC platform and combines OPENGL and Open Flight API to analyze and process CAD data. The concept level describes the concepts and entities in the real world, while the attribute level describes the attributes possessed by these concepts and entities. By combining these two levels, HDM can effectively describe the relationships between data and information at different levels in the real world. And the leaf information is established by the Billboard model. Finally, the effectiveness of the simulation evaluation method of landscape design scheme is verified by an engineering example. The simulation shows that the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm are high, and the expected idea is achieved.

The advent of mobile virtual reality has overcome some of these restrictions. However, challenges remain in multi-person evacuation scenarios, such as difficulties in relative positioning and the real time interaction of evacuees. This study addresses these issues using pose estimation for accurate positioning in virtual reality devices. Furthermore, we developed a framework for conducting evacuation drills in a real environment using mobile virtual reality, ensuring consistency in participants' visual and perceptual experiences. Subsequently, we designed two experiments to validate this methodology and framework. The experimental results demonstrated that the evacuation process, using pose estimation, effectively eliminates cumulative error, maintaining an approximate error of 0.04 m between the real and virtual environments.

The default stereoscopic parameters of consumer HMDs produce images with shallow depth to circumvent these issues. In this work, we propose a methodology to utilize the gaze-directed and visual saliency-guided paradigms for automatic stereo camera control in real-time interactive VR by employing the basics of stereo grading. We evaluate these two approaches at different levels of interaction, first through a user study and then through a performance benchmark. The results show that the gaze-directed approach outperforms the saliency-guided approach in the VEs tested and both methods are able to convey a better overall depth feeling than the default HMD setting without hindering visual comfort. It is also shown that both approaches lead to a significant overall enhancement of the VR experience in the more interactive VE. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177240289"

Existing assistive technologies for robotic wheelchair control often fail to address user needs adequately, becoming necessary an appropriate evaluation of usability and user's satisfaction for these systems. In fact, user experience and satisfaction are crucial in determining effectiveness, usability and acceptance of these technologies. The aim is to enhance the quality of life of individuals with severe motor disabilities, increasing their independence to perform some daily activities, such as locomotion. This study proposes a cloud Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP)-based Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) system to evaluate its performance through the user experience in commanding a virtual electric-powered wheelchair in a training simulator. Moreover, this study compares traditional wheelchair command modes, such as input interfaces using JoyStick (JS) and Eye Tracker (ET), through standardized questionnaires to measure motivation, ease of use, workload, discomfort, sense of presence and other relevant parameters. The analysis of user experience reveals high levels of motivation, enjoyment, and usability when using the cloud SSVEP-based BCI proposed here. Although our BCI demands higher mental work and discomforts than both ET and JS, its potential for improving the user's performance is demonstrated here. The findings of this research provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of assistive technologies, enabling the development of more personalized systems based on the user's experience. The main contributions of this study lie in a cloud BCI approach and a comprehensive evaluation methodology to evaluate the user's experience. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176427107"

Originating as a performance for rice harvesting festivals, Tumbuk Kalang as a traditional musical instrument consists of a mortar and pestles. Several players, each holding a pestle will coordinate their movements to pound on the same mortar to create rhythmic sounds whilst singing. These days, Tumbuk Kalang is no longer associated with rice harvest but has been innovated in cultural performances that include songs, dances, and other musical instruments. As machines take over rice production, pestles and mortars are out of use and the tradition of Tumbuk Kalang may be lost. Thus, this research proposes to create a Virtual Reality (VR) Tumbuk Kalang so that it can be preserved and played by future musicians. However, instead of recreating Tumbuk Kalang in VR, we suggest that innovation should be introduced in the design of the new VR Tumbuk Kalang. Hence, we have conducted a participatory design workshop with 12 musicians to design the new VR Tumbuk Kalang. The findings from the workshop produces six new designs of VR musical instruments based on Tumbuk Kalang. The contributions of this paper include the new designs of VR Tumbuk Kalang and the participatory design method used which may be replicated by other researchers who are aiming to preserve traditional musical instruments in the form of VR. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176013755"

We built a PaddlePaddle-based deep learning platform for the automatic recognition of pedestrian coordinates from the Minecraft background database. To verify the virtual experiments in Minecraft, we conducted a series of experiments under identical conditions in a real (physical) room and virtual environment on the Minecraft platform. The pedestrian behaviour, flow patterns and evacuation time in the Minecraft experiments fit well with the results of the real-life experiments, indicating the potential of Minecraft for realistically simulating evacuation processes. To further demonstrate the feasibility of using Minecraft for evacuation studies, we conducted a series of virtual evacuation experiments with different fire configurations and room geometries in Minecraft. The pedestrians were found to keep higher distance towards fire and greater detour angle during the fire emergency in a square room. Furthermore, in the scenario of a fire in a corridor, in addition to the aforementioned fire avoidance behaviours, the pedestrians exhibited orderly queuing and exited the room one by one, resulting in increased walking speeds and thus a faster evacuation for most pedestrians. Finally, one post-experiment survey was designed to assess participants' perceptions of the Minecraft environment and the pedestrian behaviours and related psychological factors. The results show that the Minecraft can generate considerate realistic real-life situations, and pedestrians chose self-organised behaviours including away from fire, along the wall and detour towards fire in both survey and evacuation experiments. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176361490"

Firstly, DL technology, especially the model of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is used to classify and identify the interactive objects in the virtual movie scene. Then, the deep reinforcement learning algorithm is used to simulate and experiment these objects to determine the best interaction mode. Finally, the best interactive effect is generated by combining the input information of the audience and the results of the deep reinforcement learning algorithm. CNN is obviously superior to the 3D modeling algorithm based on wavelet neural network (WNN) model in accuracy and recall. This improvement shows that CNN can more accurately identify the key elements and details in VR movie scenes, and has better scene layout optimization ability. The focus of the research is to create a highly realistic virtual movie scene by combining deep learning (DL) technology and computer graphics, so that the audience can interact with the VR scene more naturally. This interactive design can improve the immersive experience of the movie scene and enhance the audience's viewing experience. © 2024 U-turn Press LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176572275"

However, it is considered inefficient to undertake such construction individually, building-by-building, using 3D modeling techniques. Fortunately, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) offers a breakthrough solution. This paper proposes a method of automatic generation of architectural spaces that is based on user activities in a metaverse and that can analyze users' perceptions of such spaces. To this end, in the present study, by referencing the theory of environmental psychology, we constructed a theoretical framework that can quantitatively analyze activities, based on which, we developed a metaverse space. Architectural space images were produced based on grammatical rules, which converted the analysis results into text, as well as a deep-learning-based text-to-image generator. Twenty participants responded to two questionnaires on their perceptions and opinions after participating in the metaverse experience and after receiving the architectural space image. Consequently, we analyzed the users' opinions on the architectural space created using the data they provided. Further, we reviewed the validity of the architectural design of the virtual space created using the proposed approach and explored the possibilities of its future utilization. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174690925"

To ensure the user-perceived deadline at the transport layer, i.e., the network transmission delay and the waiting delay in the send buffer, transmission control scheme plays an important role. While several delay-sensitive transmission control schemes have been proposed, none of them consider the impact of waiting delay in the send buffer. To address this issue, we propose STOP, a joint send buffer and congestion window (CWND) control approach for guaranteeing user-perceived deadline via curriculum-guided deep reinforcement learning. To obtain optimal joint control policy, STOP utilizes a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to jointly adjust the CWND and send buffer with respect to the send buffer state, the network condition and the deadline requirement. Furthermore, to enhance the generalization capability of reinforcement learning-based algorithm, STOP incorporates curriculum learning during the training phase with a difficulty measurer and training scheduler. Extensive experiments in NS-3 indicate that the STOP scheme achieves an overwhelmingly higher average arrival ratio, i.e., around 95% vs. around 0.2%, compared with current prevalent transmission control scheme such as BBR, Cubic and Vegas. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176249958"

The extracted data relating to the research questions was descriptively analyzed and results were narratively summarized. Results: In total 23 studies were included in the review. Selected studies employed a wide range of theoretical frameworks and research designs. The studies aimed to develop competences both through complex interventions where team-based skills are required in acute situations, and they described basic nursing interventions where individual skills are required in non-acute nursing care. Conclusions: A significant amount of the selected studies did not utilize a learning theory or an instructional design framework as a basis for their research. More knowledge was found on training specific skills compared to facilitating the attitudes and values of the participants. Therefore, there is a need for further research on whether nursing students' attitudes and values can be supported through VRS with a high level of immersion. © 2023 The Authors","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177225993"

The growing presence of emerging technologies increases the potential of an innovative environment that can promote and facilitate learning. The impact of immersive technology in the field of learning has been widely discussed and studied by the scientific community in the first two decades of the 21st Century. This is especially true with the advent of the ambition for the unified and fluid multi-user virtual world - Metaverse and the limiting realities of the COVID-19 pandemic - where new modes of virtual interaction are in the spotlight, including the field of education. The success of VR educational content, especially multi-user educational content, depends, in large part, on how usable and adaptable it is for learning purposes. This study investigates pedagogic and usability principles for effective multi-user VR learning applications based on the Technology Enhanced Learning approach, Gagne’s Nine Events of Instruction model and Nielsen’s usability heuristics and analyses survey data collected during multi-user VR content testing. The study used a mixed-methods approach involving multi-user VR environment testing with a group of Higher Education students. This study tested three different VR multi-user learning applications to evaluate them from various pedagogical and usability perspectives and collected survey data to gain a deeper understanding of the students’ experience. This study proposes a framework of pedagogic and usability principles for developing effective multi-user VR learning applications. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176917171"

In this paper, based on the DEM-FEM co-simulation method, the effect of screening parameters on the dynamic response of the screen mesh is explored and the mechanism is revealed on the particle level. Firstly, a virtual experiment on a linear vibrating screen was carried out to analyze the screening parameters’ effect with both impact load and sustained stress inflicted on the screen mesh. Then, the time-domain evolution regularity of the screen mesh LVA (Local Vibration Amplitude) under different particle plugging conditions was investigated based on the co-simulation. Finally, the influence of screening parameters on LVA and its distribution was discussed. The results show that the screening parameters can greatly affect the screen mesh LVA and its distribution by changing the movement of the granular material and the particle penetration probability, which provides an important basis for the optimal design of the screen mesh and its supporting structure. © 2023 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170566673"

VR may present an opportunity to mitigate task-unrelated thought (TUT; the most common operationalization of mind wandering) because it minimizes audio-visual distractions and increases feelings of immersion. The current study tested this possibility by analyzing TUT frequency reports from 118 participants as they learned about climate change in one of two conditions: a 360° video in VR versus a traditional video on a 2D monitor. Participants answered momentary thought probes at pseudo-random intervals throughout the video and eye-gaze was recorded in both modalities. Results indicated that participants were less likely to experience TUT in the VR condition compared to non-VR (B = 0.49; p = 0.02). Consistent with prior research, TUT was also negatively related to posttest performance (B = −0.05; p = 0.01). Finally, TUT mediated the effect between learning modality on posttest performance, such that participants in VR experienced lower TUT and subsequently scored higher on the posttest (B = 0.19; p = 0.03).

We reviewed 22 studies showing target area communication, how AR/VR/Mixed reality is used in the context of communication skills in ASD children, user experience and accessibility, technology limitations, and findings. This systematic review of the literature shows that the majority of the communication areas targeted are verbal and nonverbal simultaneously. Overall, the use of AR/VR/Mixed reality can be an alternative to improve children’s communication.

The multimodal smart sensors can independently detect mechanical and thermal changes through the output signals of capacitance and resistance, respectively. Moreover, we have cultivated an artificial neural network to achieve a finger-pressing posture recognition accuracy of up to 99.259%.

The idea for this experimentation was born during the period of Covid-19 pandemic, in which it was impossible to travel freely. The goal was to make part of the exposition available to be visited virtually all over the world, in hubs equipped with VR headsets. Thanks to a collaboration with the organizers of the exposition, a VR app has been developed in order to allow people to visit the Giardino delle Vergini, which for several years has hosted the Italian Pavilion and where this year were placed the installations of prof. Giuseppe Fallacara and his research team together with the works of other international firms. Ethic matters have been taken into consideration during the app development. The VR app has been developed non to be a mere reproduction of the original site, but to be an alternative experience of visit. This work can bring two apparently contradictory advantages: on one hand the differences between virtuality and reality can encourage people to travel and visit the exposition in Venice; on the other hand, barriers of place and time are overcome. Therefore, everyone can visit the Giardino delle Vergini, even people who can’t move. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175188535"

Thus, each music segment is sliced into emotional music visualization programs. And by summarizing the obtained segment features as a whole, design an emotional feature program that can reflect the musical form. Through deep learning algorithms, it visualizes and matches the improved segment nodes, improving the expressive form of music emotional animation. © 2024, CAD Solutions, LLC.

Urbanization has become the main direction of development and is the power to promote rapid economic development. However, the development of urbanization is restricted by many factors, such as resource pressure and environmental pressure, which have a direct impact on the development of urbanization. For this problem, the concept of sponge city is put forward. In this paper, virtual reality technology is applied in the design of ecological landscape of sponge city, which can effectively alleviate the urban ecological environment and solve the urban pollution problem. In the stage of urban planning and construction, the combination of virtual reality technology and sponge city concept maximizes the characteristics of natural ecological system, has the functions of absorbing, slowing down and storing precipitation, better control of urban rainwater runoff, and promotes the healthy development of the city. This paper outlines the virtual reality technology, analyses the components and basic structure of the virtual reality system, uses the virtual reality technology as an auxiliary support for ecological landscape design, designs the sponge city ecological landscape based on the virtual reality system process, and calculates the runoff control value. Finally, some of the Experiencers are selected to evaluate and analyze the effect of this sponge City eco-landscape art design. The highest real evaluation is the real evaluation of ground paving, the result is 85.03%, the lowest real evaluation is the experience comfort, the value is 10.54%.

Traditionally, operating systems and applications have leveraged hardware tamper-proof chips, such as the Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) to implement security workflows, such as remote attestation, and to protect sensitive data against software attacks. This approach does not easily translate to the cloud environment, wherein the isolation provided by the hypervisor makes it impractical to leverage the hardware root of trust in the virtual domains. Moreover, the scalability needs of the cloud often collide with the scarce hardware resources and inherent limitations of TPMs. For this reason, existing implementations of virtual TPMs (vTPMs) are based on TPM emulators. Although more flexible and scalable, this approach is less secure. In fact, each vTPM is vulnerable to software attacks both at the virtualised and hypervisor levels. In this work, we propose a novel design for vTPMs that provides a binding to an underlying physical TPM; the new design, akin to a virtualisation extension for TPMs, extends the latest TPM 2.0 specification. We minimise the number of required additions to the TPM data structures and commands so that they do not require a new, non-backwards compatible version of the specification. Moreover, we support migration of vTPMs among TPM-equipped hosts, as this is considered a key feature in a highly virtualised environment. Finally, we propose a flexible approach to vTPM object creation that protects vTPM secrets either in hardware or software, depending on the required level of assurance. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170047258"

DDL (Data driven learning) makes full use of the network and corpus resources, changes the traditional teaching mode of conclusion based one-way indoctrination, creates a real language environment for learners, and reduces the phenomenon of interlanguage fossilization that is easy to occur in the process teaching method. It can effectively stimulate learners' interest in learning, cultivate their ability to learn independently and solve problems themselves, and achieve the ultimate goal of assisting English teaching. In view of this, this paper, based on the concept of DDL and taking the practice of English teaching reform as an example, designs a data-driven teaching model for college English, and discusses its specific implementation plan in the teaching process. The practical application of multi-agent deep RL (Reinforcement learning) algorithm is summarized and compared with other RL algorithms. The research shows that the algorithm in this paper improves the utilization rate of learning experience by 10.55%, thus greatly improving the learning performance.

OBJECTIVE: To propose an algorithm for complex 3D dental segmentation and deeply explore the correlation between segmentation results and application scenarios. METHODS: A 3D dental segmentation algorithm based on dual stream extraction of structural features and spatial features was established, and the modular design of split flow was used to avoid feature confusion. Among them, the attention mechanism on the structural feature flow was used to capture the fine-grained semantic information required for tooth segmentation, and the Tran Net based on the spatial feature flow was used to ensure the robustness of the model to complex tooth and jaw segmentation. This algorithm verified its effectiveness and reliability based on clinical datasets including healthy dental jaws and complex dental jaws such as missing teeth, malocclusion and dentition crowding. The segmentation performance of the model was measured in terms of overall accuracy, mean intersection over union, and directional cut discrepancy. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The overall segmentation accuracy of this algorithm in the clinical data set is 97.08%, and the segmentation effect is superior to that of other competitive methods from the qualitative and quantitative perspectives. It is verified that the structural feature flow designed in this paper can extract more precise local details of tooth shape from coordinate and normal information by constructing an attention aggregation mechanism, and the spatial feature flow designed in this paper can ensure the robustness of the model to complex teeth such as missing teeth, dislocated teeth, and crowded dentition by constructing a transformation network (Tran Net). Therefore, this tooth segmentation algorithm is highly reliable for clinicians' practical reference. Key words:. © 2024, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

One of the main challenges that power grids can encounter under varying and low system inertia (SI) is poor frequency response (FR). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel online tool for assessing, predicting, and enhancing the frequency stability (FS) of power systems with renewable power generation and energy storage systems (ESS). Firstly, the tool provides accurate tracking of the SI in real-time settings using recursive least square identification and Kalman filtering to provide accurate and computationally efficient results. Secondly, the tool estimates the FR of the whole system in a virtual environment for different contingencies and inertia levels. The accuracy of the FR is improved by classifying the frequency response models (FRMs) based on the SI levels. Lastly, the proposed tool computes the optimal additional estimated reserve power (ERP) required from PV and battery energy storage systems (BESS) to provide inertial and primary frequency support to the power grid at the onset of a contingency. In addition, a reserve power allocation and load-shedding strategies are proposed and implemented to dynamically adjust the reserve power of PV power plants. This dynamic control of the PV power plant reserve capacity guarantees the availability of adequate reserves for addressing unforeseen systems contingencies. Moreover, dedicated FR controllers for PV and BESS are employed to emulate the synchronous machine's inertial response (IR) and primary frequency control (PFC). The performance of the proposed tool and the FR controllers are tested and validated on a generic power grid and the IEEE 39 bus system using MATLAB Simulink and the OPAL-RT real-time simulation software. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175556682"

Randomized controlled trials that tested the effects of virtual reality-based interventions on the upper limb of participants with cerebral palsy were included. The methodological quality of the studies was measured by the PEDro scale. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. The data of the studies were analyzed in meta-analysis and presented in forest plots and narrative synthesis. Results: Twenty-two studies involving 746 participants were included. Ten different virtual reality systems were used in the interventions, of which six were designed specifically for rehabilitation and four commercial video games. We found an effect in favor of virtual reality when it was used in combination with conventional therapy for upper limb activity (SMD = 0.65; 95% CI (0.19 to 1.11)).

The design process has a clearly expressed iterative nature - each solution is initially raised as a hypothesis, which is further discussed, analysed, calculated, checked, including compliance with normative requirements, and then final decisions are made after analysing several possible alternatives. This takes place in each team (discipline) of the project participants by comparing analysis results and anticipating the possible impact of decisions on the solutions and results of other design teams (disciplines). Therefore, it is very important to coordinate, synchronize, reconcile, and manage these decision making iterations in a collaborative environment. The Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology encourages the development of harmonized information production and management processes, creating preconditions for real collaboration between design partners in a unified model (the prototype of real building) environment and enables this model to be used for multivariate virtual testing. This feature is realized through the integration of modelling and analysis and computing systems, when the data transfer from one system to another system ensures the connection between the physical and the analysis model and the integrity of their data. The article deals with the integration levels and systemic directions of architectural and structural modelling and design computation programs.

Currently, many built tunnels have poor-quality lighting with varying degrees of visual interference, which may lead to visual discomfort and traffic accidents. To solve this problem, this study proposes a method to assess and optimize the tunnel lighting quality, aiming to evaluate the lighting quality from the perspective of drivers' visual comfort and improve the lighting effect in each lighting zone of the tunnel. First, the visual characteristics of drivers and quantitative relationship between visual comfort and tunnel lighting environment are derived through field tests and mathematical statistics. Second, the comfort range based on visual characteristic indicators (VCIs) is obtained via a comprehensive analysis of objective physiological responses and subjective questionnaire survey results of drivers, which is used as the comfort criteria to assess the tunnel lighting quality. Subsequently, the effects of luminance, luminance uniformity, and flicker frequency on drivers' visual comfort are considered, and a lighting optimization model based on the adaptive penalty function particle swarm optimization algorithm is established by combining comfort constraints and energy-saving objectives. Finally, driving simulation experiments are performed using virtual reality technology, which verify the effectiveness of the assessment and optimization methods. The results show that drivers' visual comfort in the tunnel threshold zone increases with an increase in the luminance reduction coefficient and decrease in the vehicle speed, and drivers' visual comfort in the tunnel interior zone increases with an increase in the road surface illuminance and visibility. The comfort range of the VCIs classify the tunnel lighting quality into four evaluation levels. Therefore, the proposed method can accurately and quantitatively assess the comfort of the tunnel lighting environment, improving drivers' visual comfort in the tunnel by 48.08 %, while saving 12.03 % of energy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175416888"

This paper provides a systematic literature review of current academic work on blockchain-based COVID-19 supply chain management (CVSCM), addressing the role of blockchain in CVSCM and its challenges. The paper's objectives are to comprehensively analyze the literature on blockchain solutions in the CVSCM and propose a future research agenda based on gaps in the present literature. The systematic literature review involved 34 peer-reviewed journal and conference publications published between 2019 and 2022. Using a thematic analysis, we observed that the public blockchain is the most often-used blockchain platform for constructing the CVSCM frameworks. The supply chain data privacy and security are major driving factors. Blockchain technology significantly affects CVSCM by allowing for distributed transaction execution and verification. Blockchain technology enables traceability, digitalization, disintermediation of the supply chain, and enhanced data privacy. However, several challenges were identified, including privacy worries, excessive energy consumption, latency, transactional throughput, and scalability. Our results provide the groundwork for future research aimed at increasing technical integration in blockchain supply chain solutions, cross-chain interoperability, and scalability, the feasibility of commercial applications in real-world industrial settings, data security, and privacy. Future research might also closely monitor emerging technologies in CVSCM, such as edge computing, virtual reality, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and blockchain advancements, and provide more impartial support to the many research potentials discussed. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174724717"

Virtual reality technologies, which offer three-dimensional (immersive) simulation environments, have become easily accessible and cost-effective in recent years and this has this has increased this use of this technology in educating students who will work in the health field. Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the views of midwifery undergraduate students about the current episiotomy education they received and their expectations when related education is given with virtual reality technology. Participants: Students in their third or fourth year of undergraduate midwifery who have taken prior episiotomy education. Design: The research was carried out as a phenomenological design for qualitative research. Data were collected between December 2022 and January 2023 at a public university in Türkiye, with institutional ethical approval. Methods: Participants were asked open-ended questions to collect qualitative data. Data were analysed using content analysis by MaxQDA. Results: Data were analysed, and four main themes were determined. These main themes consisted of 16 sub-themes, and included midwifery department students' positive and negative opinions about the current episiotomy education and their expectations in cases where the education is carried out using virtual education environments. Conclusions: Although the current episiotomy education has positive aspects, such as suturing ability, it does not give a sense of reality, is not repetitive, and has many negative aspects, such as cost. It was determined that in virtual reality episiotomy education environments, students' expectations are similar to the real birth environment, and they have expectations of simulating risky situations because they think it will be more useful. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175817284"

In the conventional nuclear facility decommissioning, application of an automated robotic system has been difficult due to radiation and harsh environments, so simple and repetitive remote dismantling operations involving field workers has been necessary. In this paper, a digital manufacturing system and workpiece localization are applied to realize a semi-automated remote dismantling system. The digital manufacturing system and workpiece localization enable robot path planning in a virtual environment and robot path correction for a field workpiece without requiring field workers to teach the robot. This paper presents a control framework for the remote dismantling system and methodologies for building a digital model that represent the robot system applied to an actual workshop and localizing the workpiece through 3D registration. Various experimental results using a robot system of actual size and a target structure similar to reactor internals in shape and material demonstrate the successful achievement of the presented remote dismantling system. The proposed control framework and methodologies are expected to contribute to the automation of simple repetitive dismantling operations and to reduce worker exposure. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173251059"

Preventing such accidents is an important issue because older bicyclists are more likely to be fatally injured in an accident. We developed a bicycle simulator that can safely simulate dangerous traffic environments by combining VR technology, motion capture technology, and various sensors to investigate the driving behavior of bicyclists who are involved in accidents. The simulator measures operating data such as floor reaction force, wheel rotation angle, brake lever displacement, position and posture of motion capture devices, and position and posture of the bicycle and vehicles at 60 Hz. We projected images of the virtual traffic environment to reflect the driving behavior in real-time onto three screens installed at the front, right side, and rear of the bicycle using three projectors. The constructed simulator was implemented for a “crossing inspection” where a rider checks for safety in front and behind while riding down a straight road with one lane and crossing this roadway and compared this to a “tracing inspection” where a model route is traced using a previously measured safe route taken by a younger rider. We measured and analyzed the bicyclist behaviors of nine younger and six older participants during two types of inspections as a usability study. In the crossing inspection, the crash rate for the older riders in the near lane was 5.3 times higher than that for the young. Riders collided with vehicles exhibited minimal rearward checking angles before entering a roadway, extended durations from the end of the last rearward check to roadway entry, and considerable standard deviations during road crossings. Moreover, in the tracing inspection, younger participants demonstrated superior trajectory passage rates and maintained closer proximity to the model, whereas older participants manifested diminished trajectory passage rates and remained at more extended distances from the model. Notably, a declining trajectory passage rate corresponded to an increase in the standard deviation of the crossing route and the time taken to enter the roadway. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174745540"

Furthermore, with the potential and possibility of a virtual environment without physical and economic constraints, expectations for user experiences based on diverse exhibition environments are increasing. Accordingly, this study investigated the characteristics of visitor experience in relation to the spatial environment of VR exhibitions, particularly focusing on the representational fidelity of the real-physical world. We experimented with comparing the user experience in reality-based (realistically representing the physical world, high representational fidelity level) and virtuality-based (surreal, low representational fidelity level) VR exhibition settings to explore design implementation. User experience data were collected through surveys, behavioral observation by video recording, and interviews. In terms of surveys, there was no significant difference in presence and enjoyment by environment, but the reality-based environment was scored significantly higher for communication. The behavioral analysis found that more active movements were captured in the virtuality-based environment. Qualitative analysis of the interview found differences in perception, emotions, and behavior by spatial environment, such that the newness and openness of the virtuality-based environment induced active movement of participants, and the familiarity of the reality-based environment provided comfortable feelings and supported participants’ concentration on exhibition contents. The results of the study suggest how the spatial environment of VR exhibitions can contribute to user experiences. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173562767"

However, questions began to arise regarding the safety of employees. A new generation of robots, called cobots, has emerged and started to gain prominence due to their characteristics, although tools and grippers have limited security to be included in collaborative working cells. In this sense, we consider that the creation of an adaptative safety system for work cells is necessary to improve safety with minimum production impact. Our goal with the creation of an intelligent vision system is to detect humans/robots in the work cell, detect their joints using neural networks, simultaneously acquire the current position of each robot axis and determine the physical distance between the human and robot by creating a virtual environment developed in Unity. Depending on the safety level determined by the system, a different action/speed is communicated to the robot. Low speeds if the safety level is low, and higher speeds if there is no danger to the human. We only intend to make changes to the robot's speed, avoiding sudden stops or emergency stops that will eventually deteriorate the correct operation and fluidity of the robot's movements. In this sense, we present some validation results of the system's operation, performing several tests with different danger and safety distances and verifying if it can accurately identify the safety level that the human is in from the robotic collaborative work cell. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171566634"

However, the effective inhibitors that target FOXO3A are lacking and the adaptive response signaling weakens the cytotoxic effect of FOXO3A depletion on AML cells. Here, we show that FOXO3A deficiency induces a compensatory response involved in the reactive activation of mTOR that leads to signaling rebound and adaptive resistance. Mitochondrial metabolism acts downstream of mTOR to provoke activation of JNK/c-JUN via reactive oxygen species (ROS). At the molecular level, FOXO3A directly binds to the promoter of G protein gamma subunit 7 (GNG7) and preserves its expression, while GNG7 interacts with mTOR and restricts phosphorylated activation of mTOR. Consequently, combinatorial inhibition of FOXO3A and mTOR show a synergistic cytotoxic effect on AML cells and prolongs survival in a mouse model of AML. Through a structure-based virtual screening, we report one potent small-molecule FOXO3A inhibitor (Gardenoside) that exhibits a strong effect of anti-FOXO3A DNA binding. Gardenoside synergizes with rapamycin to substantially reduce tumor burden and extend survival in AML patient-derived xenograft model. These results demonstrate that mTOR can mediate adaptive resistance to FOXO3A inhibition and validate a combinatorial approach for treating AML. © 2023 Chongqing Medical University","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152905039"

Multimodal data contains information from different sources such as video, sensors, electrocardiograms (ECGs), while emotions refer to the non-verbal cues that accompany language use, such as facial expressions and body posture. Integrating these additional sources of information helps to better understand the user’s intent, which improves the performance of the sign language recognition model. To build such a model, a set of multimodal data and emotions must be collected. This data set should be differentiated and cover different individual/isolated signs, emotions and body gestures. The model is designed to integrate multimodal data and emotions, which would involve combining different machine and deep learning algorithms adapted to different types of data. In addition, the model will need to be trained to recognize the different emotions that accompany sign language. Once the model is trained, it can be tested on the test dataset to assess its performance and also plan for a test on real data (with signing people).

In order to explore the correlation mechanism between architectural space perception and user experience, this paper explores the relationship between space environment and users' physiology and psychology under the influence of differences by comparing the difference between people's subjective perception of space environment in virtual and real scenes. The research set up a comparative experimental method of virtual environment evaluation and real environment evaluation, and formed a set of research methods based on digital art to explore the changes of three indicators: people's subjective evaluation of architectural space, physiological and psychological responses of human perception to architectural space environment Condition. The research results can be used for subjective feedback in the architectural space design stage, and then accurately optimize the architectural space environment design. © 2024 U-turn Press LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175477690"

However, there is an inevitable contradiction between the number of auxiliary coded patterns and the measuring speed. To mark a large number of fringe order in high-frequency fringe projection or wide-field scenes, commonly-used strategy is to add more coded patterns, which compress heavily the ratio of phase-shifting patterns carrying the 3-D shape information of object. In this paper, a phase shift coding method is developed to mark fringe order, in which three phase-shifting patterns and one auxiliary coded pattern can obtain high-quality wrapped phase and fringe order at the same time. In addition, an interleaved projection can provide two fringe order with different densities to extend the coding range of fringe order, while ensuring the measuring speed. Experiments with various static and dynamic objects demonstrated that the proposed method with the advantages of flexibility, high-efficiency coding can achieve the reconstructing rate of 30 fps for 8-bit fringe projection. This method should be highly meaningful for practical applications of 3-D face modeling, industrial inspection, intelligent recognition, virtual reality, and so on. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166307551"

Previous studies have highlighted the need to communicate situation information to effectively support the transfer of control and responsibility of the driving task. This study explores ‘interaction types’ used for this complex human-machine transaction, by analysing how situation information is conveyed and reciprocated during a transfer of control scenario. Two human drivers alternated control in a bespoke, dual controlled driving simulator with the transfer of control being entirely reliant on verbal communication. Handover dialogues were coded based on speech-act classifications, and a cluster analysis was conducted. Four interaction types were identified for both virtual assistants (i.e., agent handing over control) - Supervisor, Information Desk, Interrogator and Converser, and drivers (i.e., agent taking control) - Coordinator, Perceiver, Inquirer and Silent Receiver. Each interaction type provides a framework of characteristics that can be used to define driver requirements and implemented in the design of future virtual assistants to support the driver in maintaining and rebuilding timely situation awareness, whilst ensuring a positive user experience. This study also provides additional insight into the role of dialogue turns and takeover time and provides recommendations for future virtual assistant designs in AVs. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174196874"

To the best of our knowledge, optical measurement of the entire deformation field is not possible, regardless of the number of cameras used in the measurement system. There are always losses near the edges, so some assumptions are required to close these spots and restore the full-field measurement. The reason for these losses is the well-known problems of the subset-based DIC technique related to the sharp edges of samples cut from sheet materials. We believe that measuring the entire full-field is not even necessary for simultaneous calibration of the normalized yield locus curve and the normalized flow curve. The joint normalization of yield locus, flow curve and elastic modulus of a material with its initial yield stress results in the same deformation field as the original material model in a finite element simulation. The deformation field is thus purely related to the material parameters normalized in this way. This fact helps in simultaneous calibration of the normalized flow curve and the yield locus by using only a selected part of the deformation field without considering the stress distribution and force measurements. The obvious proof is given that the problem breaks down to pure geometry. This is followed by the details of the approach.

Immersive media tools may be helpful in training and enhancing skill development among nursing students. Objectives: The specific aims of this study were threefold: (1) to describe the development process of an intravenous injection virtual reality simulator (IIVRS) program, (2) to determine the effect of the IIVRS program on intravenous injection knowledge, and (3) to examine the acceptability, learning motivation, and experience of the IIVRS program among nursing students. Methods: This study is a mixed method design, encompassing a one-group pre- and post-test approach and the utilization of reflection logs among 128 second-year nursing students enrolled at a university in northern Taiwan. An innovative gamification IIVRS program was developed by our research team. Knowledge of intravenous injection was assessed using a point visual analog scale at pre-and post-testing. Acceptability and motivation were assessed using items on a 5-point Likert scale. The IIVRS program experience was evaluated using open-ended questions of reflection. A paired t-test was used for comparing knowledge at pre-and post-tests, independent t-tests were conducted to compare levels of acceptance and learning motivation among different students' characteristics, and content analysis was used for qualitative data. Results: Students' knowledge of intravenous injection was significantly improved (Pre-test Mean = 3.08 vs. Post-test Mean = 4.96, p < 0.001). Students reported high levels of acceptance (Mean = 4.65) and learning motivation (Mean = 4.69). Students reported three themes of their experience: (1) attracts my attention and stimulates my motivation to learn, (2) enhanced memorization of the skill and process, and (3) a sense of presence and realism/unrealism. Conclusion: The virtual reality program for intravenous injection administration can be an effective education tool, fostering students' motivation to learn and a heightened sense of accomplishment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175335070"

This research takes residential buildings as the object, and realizes the interactive design of indoor environment through computer aided 3D modeling. This paper mainly uses computer 3D modeling technology, combined with the interior environment design theory, and through case analysis, discusses its application in the interior environment design of residential buildings. Firstly, the indoor environment model of residential buildings is established through computer 3D modeling. Then, based on design requirements, interactive design is carried out, including spatial layout, selection of decorative elements, color matching, etc. Finally, the design effect is verified through simulation experiments. The interactive design of the interior environment of residential buildings based on computer aided 3D modeling can effectively improve the design efficiency and design quality. Through 3D modeling, designers can visually see the design effect, making it easy to modify and optimize. Through interactive design, personalized design can be carried out according to user needs to improve user satisfaction. Computer aided 3D modeling has a broad application prospect in the interior environment design of residential buildings. Future research can further explore its application in the design of other types of buildings' indoor environment, and how to combine new technologies, such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, to carry out higher level interactive design. © 2024 U-turn Press LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171612110"

This research was developed with the aim of identifying motivation problems and using gamification as a pedagogical strategy to encourage reading in students. The study had a quantitative and descriptive approach that involved 30 students. Data were collected through the survey technique. The results of the research showed that reading demotivation is due to the lack of support at home, boredom and low reading comprehension that results from the use of traditional resources such as books that fail to capture and maintain the attention and interest of students. In addition, it was identified that the students present as main reading difficulties: problems of recognition of compound phonemes, lack of reading habit and motivation, as well as the deficit of reading comprehension, so it was necessary to implement a virtual strategy based on gamification through the digital tools Genially and Classflow. With the development of the research, it is concluded that the use of gamification as a pedagogical tool allows to motivate the reading of children, since its interactive elements and rewards create a stimulating and pleasant atmosphere that generates a positive impact on the performance of the student body. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174714093"

Compared to a few years ago, many things have changed, including thoughts, habits, social activities, and ways of life. Thus, this study determined the impact of virtual reality technologies as practice-oriented learning stimuli on the development of information competence and academic performance of future primary school teachers. One hundred eighteen students from the Pedagogy Faculty of the M. Utemisov West Kazakhstan University and 105 students from the Kyrgyz National University majoring in the same field were divided into two groups for the research. Respondents in the experimental group took virtual reality courses, and their progress was evaluated by contrasting their grades before and after the programme. Based on the preliminary analysis of the student’s academic performance, it should be noted that most of them performed mediocrely. However, observations by tutors and teachers revealed that when classes were taught using virtual reality platforms such as EyeJack and CoSpaces Edu, students in the experimental group were more willing to participate in tasks and seminars. Furthermore, according to the results of Content Module 2, students in the experimental group performed significantly better than students in the control group in terms of their overall academic performance (p = 4.187). The article’s practical significance comes from considering how virtual reality technologies might enhance Kazakhstan’s and Kyrgyzstan’s educational systems. © 2023, Brno University of Technology.

However, studies using VR-based working memory (WM) training in treating depressed patients' cognitive impairment are extremely scarce and how it affects cognitive performance remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to determine the efficacy of VR-WM training in acute and remitted depressed patients and try to investigate its potential mechanisms. Methods: Forty-two patients with MDD (22 acute patients and 20 remitted patients) received 20-session VR-WM training, while 22 healthy controls (HC) received no intervention. WM and other cognitive domains' performance were assessed by the Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ) and the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) before and after the intervention. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (24-HDRS) at the same time points. Results: Acute and remitted MDD patients both exhibited significant improvements from pre- to post-training in WM, processing speed, visual learning, reasoning and problem-solving, and total cognition (all p < 0.05). Significant groups-by-time interactions were observed for the 24-HDRS score (p < 0.05). Mediation analysis showed that 24-HDRS score partially mediated the association between the effect of VR-WM training on WM and total cognition performance in total depressive samples. Conclusions: VR-WM training effectively improved WM and other cognitive domains' performance in both acute and remitted MDD patients. Besides, VR-WM training improves WM and total cognition performance in MDD patients partially via the enhancement of depressive symptoms. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173650641"

However, it disrupts the head direction system because of the lack of vestibular stimulation. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel rotation platform which can be driven by the experimenter (open-loop) or by animal movement (closed-loop). The platform is modular, affordable, easy to build and open source. Additional modules presented here include cameras for monitoring eye movements, visual virtual reality, and a micro-manipulator for positioning various probes for recording or optical interference. We demonstrate the utility of the platform by recording eye movements and showing the robust activation of head-direction cells. This novel experimental apparatus combines the advantages of head fixation and intact vestibular activity in the horizontal plane. The open-loop mode can be used to study e.g., vestibular sensory representation and processing, while the closed-loop mode allows animals to navigate in rotational space, providing a better substrate for 2-D navigation in virtual environments.

Such methods rely on the availability of 3D models to generate virtual worlds and derive or render 2D image data. Since CAD models can be created on different detail levels but require extensive effort, questions arise about which affect different detail levels of 3D models have on synthetic data generation. The effect of different CAD model details is investigated and compared to different 3D scanning and photogrammetry approaches. Different synthetic datasets are created for each 3D model acquisition type and a test-benchmark set is used to evaluate the performance of each dataset. Based on the results, the suitability of each acquisition method is derived and the effects of bridging the domain gap from the synthetic training domain to the real-world application domain are discussed. The findings indicate that 3D scans are as feasible for synthetic data generation as feature-rich high-level CAD data.

However, the performance of BCV is poor and the accuracy of BCI recognition varies considerably with different subjects, which severely restrict its promotion and application. To develop a better solution, with the concept of shared control, an intention preferenced fusion brain control strategy based on fuzzy logic is proposed. Firstly, based on Fuzzy Discrete Event System Supervision (FDES) theory, instructions of the driver are supervised and evaluated. At the same time, based on fuzzy logic an automatic controller which gives an automatic decision according to the cur-rent state of the vehicle is designed. Then according to the automatic decision and the correctness of the driver's instructions, a fuzzy reasoning is made, making the final decision more in line with human intentions. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, based on our previously-designed SSMVEP platform, we conduct virtual experiments, semi-object tests and full physical tests separately for verification. Compared with others shared control schemes, it not only achieves continuous control, but the final control-making is more in line with human intentions, which can encourage users to become more involved, enhancing their self-esteem and brain functions. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171614303"

Virtualization supplements it by adding an abstraction layer to the services, as well as to the underlying infrastructure including the network layer. IP flows are calibrated by Software Defined Networks to address virtualized services directly, which is conceptually described as Network Function Virtualization. Side by side exists a diversity of devices in the cloud-to-fog continuum, which are geographically distributed, can connect to a multitude of networks, and are prone to churn. Their behavior increases the manageability and maintenance efforts needed to deploy services dynamically.

Leveraging the power of thoughts translated into processing and classifying the EEG based signals acquired from the brain result in controlling the mechatronic systems, such as robotic arms or smart wheelchairs aimed at the medical assistance of disabled persons. A robotic arm is necessary for grasping and moving different objects according to the users’ intention. Also, a simulation based on a virtual robotic arm can support the real experimentation of a complex and expensive physical robotic arm. This paper presents a prototype of a simple brain-computer interface implemented in LabVIEW programming environment for controlling a virtual robotic arm using the commands determined by the P300 evoked biopotentials and the EEG rhythms using the GTEC Unicorn headset and the related official applications. The integration between the LabVIEW proposed instrument and the Unicorn user interfaces is facilitated by the UDP data transfer. The P300 speller human faces board is associated with the generation of the commands necessary to animate specific joints from the structure of the virtual robotic arm. The EEG data frequencies (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) are mapped to the angle values of each joint (shoulder, elbow, wrist) composing the 3D robotic arm. The purpose of the proposed application is to train people how to use a brain-computer interface. It also shows the possibility of integrating the LabVIEW development environment with the Unicorn EEG technology by using the UDP transfer. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174448541"

Reflecting on virtual spectatorship in the context of social isolation, the present study investigates whether VR cinemas could provide an alternative for collective movie watching and whether they could facilitate an engaging experience similar to other, physical-world co-viewing environments. To measure these effects, we designed a behavioral experiment in which participants watched a feature film sequence either in VR or a physical screening room in the presence or absence of viewing companions. After viewing, participants’ experiences—including emotional engagement, narrative empathy, presence, social experiences, and physical and mental well-being—were recorded using survey methods. We observed that VR viewing can produce an equally enjoyable film experience, as well as similar levels of emotional engagement and narrative empathy, while it leads to increased comprehension of characters’ feelings and sense of narrative engagement. In addition, social viewing may mean less engagement and more distractions depending on the screening environment. We also found that even though previous virtual reality exposure negatively correlates with comfort and well-being during viewing, early adopters of technology and VR supporters are more likely to have an enjoyable and engaging film experience. © 2023","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171841125"

The importance of metaverse escapism although has been discussed in current literatures, but what can be its drivers and consequences is unclear. From a theoretical perspective, escapism can be modelled in two way: cause-based (positivist) and effect-based (negativist). In this work we propose a positivist approach by theorizing how different types of real-life problems (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) will drive metaverse escapism, fostering attachment with this virtual place. We collect 585 responses from users of VR-based metaverse applications like Horizon World, VR Chat, etc. The results are analysed using Partial Least Squares based Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) technique. We found that only autonomy and competence problems lead to metaverse escapism, and further to virtual place attachment. Metaverse escapism acts like a full mediator in the link between real-world problems and virtual place attachment. Likewise, anxiety positively moderates the relationship between competence problem and escapism, but negatively moderates the relationship between autonomy problem and escapism. Our work contributes to the metaverse literatures by identifying those who are likely to engage in metaverse escapism. Our model explains 60.4% of the variance in virtual place attachment, indicating the practical significance of identifying the correct targets and fostering their attachment with this virtual world. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174450730"

The objective is to propose a computerized assessment tool for upper extremities motor performance in PD. It is based on kinematic indices and a virtual reality exergaming system. The reliability, construct and discriminative validity of the proposed tool were investigated. Methods: A set of virtual tasks was designed and integrated to the therapeutic programs of the participants including uni/bimanual, in-phase/anti-phase hand movements on the less/more affected sides. 33 persons with PD participated in a test re-test study to determine the reliability, discriminative validity on the medication states, and validity of the kinematic indices. Clinical assessments, including Box and Block Test, 9-Hole Peg Test, Movement Disorders Society motor section of the Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS III), were performed for validity assessment. Results: Task type has a significant impact on the validity of the indices. Reaching tasks were shown to be superior. Besides, it was demonstrated that a minimum of 3 repeats is needed for reliable results in the proposed setting. Jerk indices, curvature, and spectral speed metrics lack either reliability or validity. Temporal speed metrics have superior reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient ICC ≥ 0.9) and validity (Pearson ≥ 0.6) in reaching tasks.

The study employed participation observations (a representative sample of ten heads of the family from Medina) when VR was applied to redesign their living rooms; semi-structured one-on-one interviews were conducted after the experience. The concept of BD in residential environments was developed using an inductive approach. The results showed that all participants perceived more than 50 percent of the visual BD features included in the design. Environmental features of color, water, and natural materials were most easily perceived; among natural shapes and forms, biomimicry, botanical motifs, shapes resisting straight lines, and biomorphy were perceived more compared to egg-shaped, oval, and tubular forms. Although arches, vaults, and domes, as well as biomimicry, were mentioned in the interviews, they were not mentioned in the spontaneous description based on observations. This study introduces a research method for applying VR to the perception of BD. The study selected ten families and redesigned their living rooms with BD elements. The participants viewed the modified environment through VR glasses and expressed their feelings during the interviews. Data analysis was conducted to determine the significance of each BD element and the degree to which it was perceived. Exploration with advanced VR technology that allows participants to walk among the redesigned interiors is required. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks.

Virtual Reality (VR) technology offers a detailed way of viewing a product and achieves a higher level of subject immersion when interacting with the product in an virtual environment. Computer Aided Design (CAD), on the other hand offers the designer an enhanced level of detail that allows for the creation of two-dimensional and three-dimensional representations which replace sketches and representations made by hand. Both formats, then, offer different degrees of product representation realism. This work will compare product preference in VR and CAD environments for a range of coffee cup designs. The product preference is gathered via a Discrete Choice Experiment(DCE). The subjects are categorized by gender, and previous CAD and VR experience. Designs of coffee cups were parameterized and the subjects where shown two cups at a time and asked to inspect them and choose the one they like the most. This process was applied for both VR and CAD environments. The data of 108 subjects was collected then analyzed. This analysis points to the fact that that there are significant preference differences between VR and CAD.

An important factor making avatars realistic is clothes. In this paper, we investigate a new method to reconstruct realistic garments from a set of images and body information. Early methods working on realistic images struggle to faithfully reconstruct the garment details. As deep learning is increasingly applied to geometric data which can conveniently represent garments, we devise a novel deep learning-based solution to the garment reconstruction problem. We offer a new perspective on the reconstruction problem and treat it as a reversion of the smoothing diffusion process. To achieve this goal, we propose to deform the smoothed human mesh into a clothed human via a Double Reverse Diffusion (DReD) process. For the first reverse diffusion, we introduce a novel operator called Graph Long Short-Term Memory (GraphLSTM) which recursively diffuses features to produce a deformed mesh by modeling the relationships between vertices. Then, the output mesh can be repeatedly upsampled and deformed by the above pipeline to obtain finer garment details, which can be seen as another reverse diffusion process.

Conventionally, medical professionals have used Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) viewer software to display data captured with 3D X-ray CT in three directions (axial, sagittal, and coronal section) on a PC monitor. Since surface and volume rendering on AR, VR, and MR is primarily used, making it is difficult for the observer to accurately represent the region of interest. In our previous research, a 3D expression system that 2D cross-section images output from DICOM on the surface-rendered object has been proposed. In this study, a representation method using a 3D expression system and showing AR images allows the user to check the internal structure of an object imaged by 3D X-ray CT in any position and rotation has been newly proposed. In addition, in order to express a cross-section of a virtual object at close range in real-time, HTC VIVE Pro, which is a camera-mounted device connected to a PC, enabled a video see-through expression. As a result, a 3D X-ray CT reading assistance system enabled the user to confirm the internal structure of a specific part of a CT-imaged object in a virtual reality space while maintaining shading and a three-dimensional impression. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174444985"

The authors have measured the gap between academic research and the current practice of museum management through a mixed-methodology approach. On one hand, the text presents the result of a systematic literature review of articles on museum digitalization that have been published since 2000. On the other hand, it includes the results of an interview with a group of experts, directors, and curators of Italian museums to understand the degree to which digitalization is currently adopted in those cultural institutions. COVID-19 is an additional factor that has been considered in terms of its impact on scientific production and museums’ strategies. Such cultural institutions, having ticketing and similar forms of revenue related to physical visitors at the core of their model of economic sustainability, suddenly realized the need for a different approach to promoting art, namely forms of engagement from a distance. Within the frame of industry 4.0, it has become evident the crucial role experts play in the field of digitalization and implementation of virtual environments for the art sector. This text aims to draft a research agenda on museum digitalization for the near future, looking at trending topics, academic networks, and research geographies. The qualitative survey with experts’ opinions discussed whether regular employment of digital platforms and virtual tours can engage new visitors in the long term, and established the current status of their day-to-day activities. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175149751"

However, due to the ambiguities of human occlusion, depth blurring and the lack of training data, the accuracy of motion capture is still far from satisfactory. This paper reviews the advances of human pose estimation methods in markerless motion capture since 2019. We propose three types of representations for the human body, and detect that a unified volumetric model provides more detailed motion representation. We introduce datasets and evaluation metrics widely used for 2D and 3D pose estimation. Comparisons and discussions are conducted on different model frameworks for human pose estimation based on accuracy, robustness, and speed, summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of various methods. We discover that pose estimation methods based on the Transformer framework exhibit better accuracy and robustness, while kinematic and physical knowledge greatly assist in solving 3D pose estimation. Additionally, lightweight methods are often overlooked in research. In conclusion, this paper serves as a guide for researchers interested in the field and assists newcomers in selecting and developing human pose estimation methods. © 2024 U-turn Press LLC, http://www.cad-journal.net.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173565167"

In the urban context, however, more evidence is needed for a better understanding of the short-term health impacts of nearby nature. To address this limitation, we investigated the dynamic influence of transitions between built and natural environments on urban residents using Cave Automated Virtual Environment (CAVE) immersive virtual reality technology. In this experiment, we filmed two pairs of 360° 8K videos of geographically adjacent built and natural environments in Boston, MA to mimic real-life environmental exposure of urban residents, and created virtual immersive stimuli with an 8K-resolution curved panoramic screen accompanied with a 7.2 Dolby Surround 360° audio system. We recruited 171 participants in a randomized crossover experiment to evaluate physiological and psychological responses to transitions between urban built and natural environments. Our psychological results indicate significant reductions in negative mood dimensions, total mood disturbance, and transient anxiety, during the transition from built to natural environments; and increases during the transition from natural to built environments. In addition, we observed participants showed more emotional responses to nature through physiological measures. Lastly, we found that contextual factors that were rarely tested in previous studies, including differential physical health conditions, underlying stress levels, formative experience with nature, and growth environments, might influence the extent of stress recovery. This study provided empirical evidence from the health perspective for promoting nearby nature in urban built environments. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173221632"

However, whether immersive VR technologies improve the chances of selling real estate is unclear. This study examines the effects induced by a real estate website that offers the opportunity to evaluate the potential purchase of a property in two ways: by viewing photos of the house (non-immersive conditions) and by taking a virtual tour of the same house using a VR head-mounted display (immersive conditions). Forty participants interested in evaluating the purchase of a new house, randomly assigned to one of the experimental conditions, participated in the experiment. During the real estate experience, electroencephalography (EEG) and skin conductance (SC) were recorded to collect biological data about the emotional effects raised by each condition. After the study, psychological self-reported questionnaires were collected measuring: emotions, presence, user experience (UX), and a three-item ad hoc scale exploring behavioral intentions (e.g., the perceived pleasantness of the house, the willingness to visit the house, and the purchase intention). Results show that immersive navigation is associated with more positive emotions (EEG), more intense physiological arousal (SC), higher scores on the presence questionnaire, and higher scores on the UX questionnaire compared to the non-immersive one. The psychological scales measuring emotions did not yield significant results. No significant difference in the three-item ad-hoc self-questionnaire was found, except for the item examining willingness to visit the real house building.

However, the human perceptual abilities for curvature gain are mainly estimated on single walking paths in some large spaces, showing a lack of understanding the cognitive performance for more complex path conditions in room-size spaces. To explore this issue, this paper conducts three studies by using a novel psychophysical method of limits to evaluate human perception of curvature gain under different conditions of virtual paths. First, we evaluate the perception of path curving under a single path condition and reveal the impact of the path curving direction. Second, we study the ability to perceive curvature gain on a postorder path when the curving direction and degree of its preorder path vary. Our results show a moderation effect on the perceptual ability for the postorder path if both paths are in the same curving direction. Finally, we explore the effect of the preorder path length on the human sensitivity to the postorder curvature gain and demonstrate that longer preorder paths can increase the ability of users to adapt to postorder path curving. This paper reveals the adaptation characteristic of the curvature gain under complex path conditions, contributing to the development of path-based RDW methods. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173802758"

Necessarily, extended stent lifetime will become more critical for new generation devices. In vitro methods commonly used for TAVR stent fatigue testing exclude the effects of the beating heart. We present a more realistic in silico stent fatigue analysis utilizing a beating heart model in which TAVR stents experience complex, nonuniform dynamic loading. Methods: Virtual TAVR deployments were simulated in the SIMULIA Living Heart Human Model of a beating heart using stent models of the self-expandable nitinol 26-mm CoreValve and Evolut R devices, and a 27-mm PolyV-2. Stent deformation was monitored over three cardiac cycles, and fatigue resistance was evaluated for the nitinol stents using finite element analysis via ABAQUS/Explicit. The average strain and strain amplitude of each stent element were tracked, and established thresholds were applied to determine potential fatigue failure. Fatigue performance of control stents was compared to parametrically modified models with a 20% increase or decrease in strut width. Results: Stents with reduced strut width applied lower radial force against the contracting myocardium of the beating heart, resulting in larger displacements and higher strain values. Formulas relating in vivo strain to stent design do not account for this. In all models, there were elements in which strains exceeded fatigue failure. The PolyV-2 stent had far fewer failing elements since its struts were optimized to reduce the strain in stent joints, achieving better fatigue resistance in the stent crown and waist elements. Different stent sections showed markedly different fatigue resistance due to the varying loading conditions. Conclusions: Our analysis indicates that previous studies underestimate strain amplitudes that may cause stent failure. This study demonstrates the utility of advanced in silico analysis of devices deployed within a beating heart that mimics in vivo loading, offering a cost-effective alternative to human or animal trials and establishing a platform to assess the impact of device design on device durability. The limited fatigue life of TAVR stents indicated here highlights a clinical complication that may eventually develop as younger, lower-risk TAVR patients, age. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175561791"

In Study 1 (N = 230), real-world exercise preferences were explored. Study 2 (N = 228) measured preferences for real-world and virtual reality (VR) exercise, and Study 3 (N = 249) investigated preferences for avatar embodiment and virtual companions within VR. Results revealed that participants who preferred home-based exercise had lower exercise behaviour, more negative fitness-related social comparisons, or lower SPE expectancy and outcome value (Study 1). Individuals with lower exercise behaviour, more negative fitness-related social comparisons, lower SPE expectancy, or higher SPA were also more likely to choose VR than real-world exercise (Study 2). In a VR exercise setting, participants with higher SPA and more negative social comparisons also preferred to embody a non-human and fantasy avatar more than a realistic avatar. A heightened threat of negative social comparison when imagining exercise with a physically superior virtual companion resulted in the strongest preference to embody a fantasy avatar (Study 3). The results suggest that individuals who place high importance on self-presentation and have low belief in their capacity to project an image of competence to others, are more likely to prefer exercise contexts that minimise physique- and fitness-related evaluation. Moreover, VR may afford a less psychosocially threatening context for individuals who feel self-conscious or comparatively inferior to others during exercise. © 2023 The Author","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169794414"

However, fostering robust social relationships among objects within intelligent environments requires considering a multitude of parameters, from historical transactions data to peer opinions on interaction experiences. Our primary objective is to introduce the VISO concept, a finely tuned approach for community formation and facilitating autonomous interactions among Social IoT objects. Key contributions of VISO include: (i) a recommendation mechanism for cultivating friendships; (ii) the virtualization of devices, known as Virtual Objects, based on the Digital Twin concept; (iii) object ranking, determined by peer evaluations at the edge; and (iv) profiling the identity of each object within the environment. The VISO approach is rooted in the link analysis model, which seeks to uncover connections between individuals and qualify interactions. Additionally, the construction of social circles is guided by the Organizational Network Analysis model, a concept grounded in social networks designed to simplify the initiation of new friendships. The VISO approach stands out through its amalgamation of dynamic trust mechanisms, object virtualization, real-time interaction monitoring, and the highlighting of the most active objects. These characteristics collectively contribute to its effectiveness in managing relationships within the social IoT, while simultaneously addressing challenges posed by alternative models. Preliminary results in a testing environment substantiate the model's capability to categorize interactions and identify the most beneficial object roles for establishing new relationships. In particular, by selecting the most active objects 30%, they account for a staggering 90% of local actions. These validation outcomes lay the foundation for planned future work and enhancements to the VISO approach. Encouraged by the promising results, the inception of a significant project is on the horizon. The application of the VISO approach to relationship management within a smart campus for ubiquitous education underscores the remarkable versatility and potential of Social IoT. This application has the power to elevate various facets of campus life, ranging from education to resource management, creating a transformative impact within the educational landscape. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171598871"

The AR world market is estimated to have over 1.7 billion users by the mid 2020s and generate over $60 billion USD. This paper explores the intricate realm of consumer expectations and experiences regarding Augmented Reality (AR) apps, specifically in the fashion retail sector. Using a triangulation qualitative approach (via online reviews, focus groups and semi-structured interviews), this study aims to understand the practical, consumer-centric aspects of AR apps – an overlooked area of the field, as many studies have focus on the technical aspects of AR apps. The study also develops a framework for understanding AR's use in fashion retail and understanding consumer expectations and experiences linked to the AR apps. Key findings revealed that consumers appreciate AR apps for providing a unique, immersive shopping experience akin to in-store shopping, with advanced features such as 3D visualization. The study also identifies features that influence consumer goals, including the ability to try on products virtually, ease of navigation, and the inclusion of advanced features like a 3D visual experience. The implications of this study are vast, offering insights for app developers to enhance user experiences, prevent negative reviews, and foster a positive perception of AR apps among consumers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173675717"

The present study used a virtual reality system named “Jazz-Drum-VR” which embedded a function to analyze learners' performance of simulating jazz drumming. The system enabled learners to know their mistakes and correct them based on its spontaneous feedback to promote the effectiveness of their rhythm learning. To understand whether this game could effectively enhance students' rhythm performance, this study adopted the cognitive-affective theory of multimedia to explore the relationship between students' gameplay anxiety, flow experience, and learning effectiveness when playing “Jazz-Drum-VR.” Using purposive sampling, students in a high school were invited to take part in a quasi-experimental single-group time serial study involving five sessions over a period of 4 weeks. A total of 67 useful data were collected after Jazz-Drum-VR practices, and confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling analysis were performed. Results revealed that rhythm incremental beliefs can negatively predict gameplay anxiety and positively predict flow experience; flow experience can positively predict perceived learning value and learning effectiveness; and perceived learning value can positively predict learning progress. The results implied that practicing Jazz-Drum-VR could significantly promote rhythm accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175198168"

However, palliative cancer patients may require inpatient hospital care for medical reasons. Virtual reality (VR) could provide an approximation to the individuals’ home environment. Methods: The project consists of 3 parts. All parts are supported by the patient advisory board. In the 1st part of the project, we interview patients, relatives, and the patient advisory board about their wishes and concerns regarding the project. In the 2nd part of the project, patients are offered to view 360° VR videos of their choice (their home, relatives, others if applicable). Effects and side-effects of the intervention are assessed with validated instruments (MIDOS, MDBF, SSQ, SPES). Diagnosis, treatment adherence, medication, and vegetative functionality is determined from the medical records of the patients. In the 3rd part of the project, the results of the study will be discussed with patients, relatives, health care professionals and the patient advisory board regarding implementation. Discussion: This study is the first to investigate whether individualized VR videos have additional benefits over generic VR nature videos on symptom relief, well-being, treatment satisfaction, and adherence in patients with palliative cancer care. A strength of the study is that we can incorporate the results of each part of the project into the subsequent project parts. However, the generalizability might be limited as this is a single-centred study.

However, real-world cycling data is scarce and on-road testing presents safety concerns. This study presents a novel way of studying cyclists’ perceptions of bicycle infrastructure design alternatives using immersive virtual environments modeled after a real-world corridor, and a previously validated bike simulator at the University of Virginia, U.S. Three infrastructure scenarios were tested: sharing lanes with motor vehicles marked with sharrows (with no bike lane), a separated bike lane, and a protected bike lane with flexible delineators. Surveys elicited data on participants’ preferences and perceptions of safety, as well as demographic and socioeconomic data. Smartwatches collected heart rate (HR) data. A multinomial logit model examined the relationship between sociodemographic and physiological variables and preferences for bicycle infrastructure. Results suggest gender, age, and abrupt changes in HR affect cyclists’ preferences for bike infrastructure design. Overall, gender emerges as the most practically significant predictor variable for bicycle infrastructure preference, with men more likely to prefer sharrows and women more likely to prefer protected bike lanes. Exploratory analysis also suggests that bicyclists who self-identified as “strong and fearless” were more likely to choose sharrows as the preferred design, while bicyclists who self-identified as “interested but concerned” more often chose the protected bike lane. These results highlight the importance of understanding preferences of not just current cyclists, but potential future cyclists. Virtual reality simulation offers a low-cost, safe, and efficient method to understand preferences of individuals interested but not yet choosing cycling as a mode. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176779955"

Although advanced input modalities such as hand or gaze tracking have been developed, they have yet to be widely adopted in available hardware. Modern smartwatches have been shown to provide a powerful and intuitive means of input, thereby overcoming the limitation of the current AR/VR headsets. They typically offer a set of interesting input modalities, such as a touchscreen, rotary buttons, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which can be used for mid-air gesture recognition. Compared to other input devices, they have the benefit that they are hands-free as soon as the user stops interacting since they are attached to the wrist. As many concepts have been proposed, comparative evaluations of their effectiveness and user-friendliness are still rare. In this paper, we evaluate the usability of two commonly found approaches for using a smartwatch as an interaction device, specifically in immersive environments provided by AR/VR HMDs: using the physical inputs of the watch (touchscreen, rotary buttons) or mid-air gestures. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, where they tested both of the interaction methods, and we compared them in their usability and performance. Based on a prototypical AR application, we evaluated the performance and user experience of these two smartwatch-based interaction concepts. We have found that the input using a touchscreen and buttons was generally favored by the participants and led to shorter task completion times. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174924394"

Generally, when conducting an experiment using a driving simulator to gain new findings, an experimental driving course is required and the influence of familiarization with the course affecting the results is inevitable. Traditionally, to remove this influence of familiarization with driving courses from a targeted evaluation criterion, predictable driving courses such as straight-based roads like city roads and expressways, roads with gentle curves like country roads and mountain ones, are employed. However, it is still questionable whether findings from those driving courses would hold for variation of driving courses which play an important role in understanding the findings in reality. This manuscript focuses on the progress of familiarization with a driving course and clarifies what properties of driving behaviors are influenced from it. The findings show that people control speed of a car with fewer presses of the acceleration pedal (the number of counts of pushing the gas pedal decreased by -11.6%) with less pressure applied (degree of pushing decreased by -12.8%), leading to driving more slowly as they drive around 7 ∼ 9 driving laps. In addition, they manipulate the steering wheel with a smaller operating range (standard deviation of angular position of the steering wheel decreased by -5.7%), so that lane keeping becomes more precise (lateral deviation decreased by -28.7%) as they drive around 4 ∼ 6 driving laps. Finally, user familiarization with driving courses is dealt with in this manuscript and our ultimate goal is to quantify user familiarization, predict its level, and give drivers feedback on it in real time so that they are warned to be drive carefully. The outcome of this manuscript is a first step and quantify the user familiarization. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Intelligent Transportation Systems Japan.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173978404"

We used librarian-designed searches of 10 databases to identify research articles on randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of nonimmersive virtual reality in intervening spastic cerebral palsy patients up to April 15, 2023. Independent evaluation was conducted by two trained investigators using the evaluation criteria of randomized controlled trial quality indicated in the Cochrane Manual of Assessment ""risk-of-bias tool."" The Physical Therapy Evidence Database scale was used to evaluate the method and quality of the literature. Twenty-one research articles involving 779 patients with spastic cerebral palsy were included. Significant differences between the nonimmersive virtual reality rehabilitation and traditional rehabilitation groups were observed in all indicators, except for the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test. Nonimmersive virtual reality intervention is effective in improving the function of the lower extremity, balance, and social participation in children with spastic cerebral palsy, but its effect on upper limb function is still controversial.

Self-organizing swarm mechanism for flexible decision-making is established by combing control theory with repulsive potentials, thereby lifting orientation constraints on USV swarm coordination. Distributed finite-time extended state observers are devised to sufficiently accommodate multiple unknowns covering internal dynamics and external uncertainties/disturbances. Swarming coordination of individual USV is optimally synthesized by reinforcement learning-based distributed control architecture. As a consequence, semi-global asymptotic stability of the entire self-organizing swarm can be rigorously ensured by Lyapunov analysis. Virtual-reality experiments show that reinforcement learning swarm is skilled in coordinating a herd of USVs tracking a trajectory. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177174277"

A total of 24 participants used a setup that included a Franka Emika Panda robot arm, Varjo XR-3 head-mounted display, and Leap Motion Controller. Participants performed a box-and-block task using the bare hand (A), and under five gesture-controlled robotic operation methods: direct sight (B), sight via video-feedthrough (C), in a 3D telepresence environment with (D) and without (E) virtual representation of the robot arm, and using a 2D video feed (F). The number of grabbing attempts did not differ significantly between conditions, but local operation (B & C) yielded more transferred blocks than teleoperation (D–F). Teleoperation using a 3D presentation was advantageous compared to teleoperation using a 2D video feed, as demonstrated by lower peak forces and smaller range in gripper heights in conditions D and E compared to condition F, a finding supported by analyses of the head movement activity. Finally, the bare hand yielded the best performance and subjective ratings. In summary, teleoperation using a 3D presentation provided a smoother interaction than teleoperation with a 2D video feed.

In this context, the targeted application of these interventions is deemed as crucial as assessing their overall effectiveness. The aim of this study was to characterize the patient profile who benefited most from immersive virtual reality (VR) therapy. Methods: Based on the results from the previous randomized controlled trial study, we employed an exploratory study design to determine the factors associated with the most significant mental health improvement. A secondary analysis was conducted on a sample of 83 participants, with further analysis of participants with elevated depression symptoms, as indicated by a score of > 10 on the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-30). Both groups participated in a similar post-stroke rehabilitation program; however, the experimental group also received additional VR therapy through an immersive VR garden intervention. The GDS-30 was used to assess mood and depressive symptoms, and sociodemographic, cognitive status as well as stroke-related variables were considered as potential factors. Results: In both the experimental (mean change 5.3) and control groups (mean change 2.8), interventions significantly reduced depressive symptoms, with a more pronounced difference in the experimental group (p < 0.05). When examining gender differences, women exhibited greater improvement in the GDS, with mean between-group differences of 5.0 for the total sample and 6.0 for those with elevated depressive symptoms. Sociodemographic factors, cognitive status, and time from stroke were not found to be factors that alter the effectiveness of VR therapy. Conclusions: While VR therapy as an adjunctive treatment for post-stroke rehabilitation seems especially effective for women with elevated depressive symptoms, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the study’s small experimental group size. Traditional methods showed reduced effectiveness in women compared to men; thus, developing technologically advanced and gender-specific approaches can lead to more tailored therapy.

The neural substrates that underlie these alterations in spatial cognition however, remain incompletely understood. Here, we used electrophysiology and calcium imaging to examine ketamine’s impacts on the medial entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, which contain neurons that encode an animal’s spatial position, as mice navigated virtual reality and real world environments. Ketamine acutely increased firing rates, degraded cell-pair temporal firing-rate relationships, and altered oscillations, leading to longer-term remapping of spatial representations. In the reciprocally connected hippocampus, the activity of neurons that encode the position of the animal was suppressed after ketamine administration. Together, these findings demonstrate ketamine-induced dysfunction of the MEC-hippocampal circuit at the single cell, local-circuit population, and network levels, connecting previously demonstrated physiological effects of ketamine on spatial cognition to alterations in the spatial navigation circuit. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173954829"

For industrial datasets, the collection and annotation of images and videos is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone. In the past decade, With the development of rendering technology and hardware capability, more and more researches tend to use virtual datasets to overcome the shortcomings of real datasets. We studied the method of expanding the small sample data set of sprayed workpieces to solve the positioning problem of sprayed workpieces. We build the 3D model of sprayed workpieces and the factory environment in the virtual environment. We use blender software to render workpieces in different environments, and automatically generate the ground-truth label. In order to verify the effectiveness of this expansion method, We use real dataset, virtual dataset, and mixed dataset for model training. In our study, enhancements were made to the SiamFC++ model. Specifically, the backbone network was replaced with the ConvNeXt model, which boasts superior feature extraction capability. Additionally, we innovated the loss function by transitioning from IoU loss to CIoU loss, thereby introducing penalty terms for central point distance and shape consistency. Within the experimental section, we compared the performances of the SiamFC++ model using the AlexNet backbone network and the ConvNeXt backbone network. When trained solely on real datasets, the accuracy rates of the two model versions were 80.1% and 80.5% respectively. With virtual dataset training, the accuracy rates of the two versions improved by 6% and 7.4% respectively. When trained on mixed datasets, the accuracy rates of the two model versions saw respective enhancements of 8% and 8.6%. In all three training conditions, the ConvNeXt-based version of the model consistently outperformed the AlexNet-based version. Our improved model was further compared to mainstream object tracking models to validate its tracking efficacy. To substantiate the effectiveness of our model enhancements, we performed comprehensive ablation studies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173807609"

However, most previous studies focused on the respective feature representations of keypoints, but disregarded the topological relationship among keypoints. To address this challenge, we propose GTPose, a network structure that integrates graph convolutional networks and Transform. First of all, a set of multi-scale convolution operations are applied to extract local feature maps of images. Secondly, the positions of keypoints are roughly estimated by using Transform to process the sequential relations between feature maps. Finally, GCN is adopted to model the topological structure between keypoints to accurately locate the location of keypoints and learn feature representations. The performance of GTPose is evaluated on two real datasets: MS COCO and MPII. Experimental results demonstrate that GTPose outperforms other methods in human pose estimation tasks. In addition, experimental results also show that the spatial relationship between keypoints is effective for accurately characterizing keypoints. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177557056"

We refer to this combined approach as iMD-VR-FE. Stage one involves using a state-of-the-art ‘human-in-the-loop’ iMD-VR framework to generate a diverse range of protein–ligand unbinding pathways, benefitting from the sophistication of human spatial and chemical intuition. Stage two involves using the iMD-VR-sampled pathways as initial guesses for defining a path-based reaction coordinate from which we can obtain a corresponding free energy profile using FE methods. To investigate the performance of the method, we apply iMD-VR-FE to investigate the unbinding of a benzamidine ligand from a trypsin protein. The binding free energy calculated using iMD-VR-FE is similar for each pathway, indicating internal consistency. Moreover, the resulting free energy profiles can distinguish energetic differences between pathways corresponding to various protein–ligand conformations (e.g., helping to identify pathways that are more favourable) and enable identification of metastable states along the pathways. The two-step iMD-VR-FE approach offers an intuitive way for researchers to test hypotheses for candidate pathways in biomolecular systems, quickly obtaining both qualitative and quantitative insight. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173785558"

However, there are still unresolved challenges in efficiently rendering global illumination effects. At the same time, machine learning and computer vision provide real-world image analysis and synthesis methods, which can be exploited by computer graphics rendering pipelines. Deep learning-enhanced rendering combines techniques from deep learning and computer vision into the traditional graphics rendering pipeline to enhance existing rasterization or Monte Carlo integration renderers.

Specifically, we focus on works of renderers represented using neural networks, whether the scene is represented by neural networks or traditional scene files. These works are either for general scenes or specific scenes, which are differentiated by the need to retrain the network for new scenes. © 2023, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176119587"

However, rendering visual stimuli is computationally heavy. Thus, optimizations must be done to take advantage of computational systems by studying our perception of reality. This study investigated parameters related to light rendering (Global Illumination, Ambient Occlusion, Screen Space Reflections (SSR) and Direct Shadows) in real-time in a virtual replica of a real place using IVR. Participants experienced both virtual and real rooms with only one flashlight and changed the quality settings of the considered parameters so that their sense of reality would be the closest to the one they felt when they experienced the real room. Participants were given a budget to drive them to prioritize what parameters, and their level of quality, are the most important for their sense of reality. Results indicated that participants considered Global Illumination the most important factor, closely followed by Direct Shadows. Ambient Occlusion and Reflections (Screen Space Reflections) were the less prioritized parameters. We conclude that in a lighting setting where only dynamic lights are used, Global Illumination and Direct Shadows should be prioritized over SSR Reflections and Ambient Occlusion when computational power is limited. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176090271"

It has been argued that degraded hearing makes listening effortful, causing competition for higher-level cognitive resources needed for secondary cognitive or motor tasks. Therefore, executive function training has the potential to improve cognitive performance, in turn improving mobility, especially when older adults with hearing loss are engaged in effortful listening. Moreover, research using mobile neuroimaging and ecologically valid measures of cognition and mobility in this population is limited. The objective of this research is to examine the effect of at-home cognitive training on dual-task performance using laboratory and simulated real-world conditions in normal-hearing adults and older hearing aid users. We hypothesize that executive function training will lead to greater improvements in cognitive-motor dual-task performance compared to a wait-list control group. We also hypothesize that executive function training will lead to the largest dual-task improvements in older hearing aid users, followed by normal-hearing older adults, and then middle-aged adults. Methods: A multi-site (Concordia University and KITE-Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, University Health Network) single-blinded randomized controlled trial will be conducted whereby participants are randomized to either 12 weeks of at-home computerized executive function training or a wait-list control. Participants will consist of normal-hearing middle-aged adults (45–60 years old) and older adults (65–80 years old), as well as older hearing aid users (65–80 years old, ≥ 6 months hearing aid experience). Separate samples will undergo the same training protocol and the same pre- and post-evaluations of cognition, hearing, and mobility across sites. The primary dual-task outcome measures will involve either static balance (KITE site) or treadmill walking (Concordia site) with a secondary auditory-cognitive task. Dual-task performance will be assessed in an immersive virtual reality environment in KITE’s StreetLab and brain activity will be measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy at Concordia’s PERFORM Centre. Discussion: This research will establish the efficacy of an at-home cognitive training program on complex auditory and motor functioning under laboratory and simulated real-world conditions. This will contribute to rehabilitation strategies in order to mitigate or prevent physical and cognitive decline in older adults with hearing loss.

In this letter, we aim to develop a lightweight yet highly effective self-supervised MDE model that can deliver competitive performance in edge devices. We introduce a novel MobileViT-based depth (MViTDepth) network that can effectively capture both local features and global information by leveraging the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a vision transformer (ViT). To further compress the proposed MViTDepth model, we employ knowledge distillation, which leads to improved depth estimation performance. Specifically, the self-supervised MDE MonoViT is used as a teacher model to construct the knowledge distillation loss for optimizing a student model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MViTDepth significantly outperforms Monodepth2 in terms of parameters and accuracy, thereby indicating its superiority in application to edge devices.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177241001"

Virtual reality (VR) provides users with an easy way to become engaged in social activities without leaving the house. This study focused on adults, who were socialising in Altspace VR, a social VR platform, during the Covid-19 pandemic and it explored whether social VR could alleviate feelings of loneliness and social anxiety. A mixed-methods research design was applied. Participants (n = 74), aged 18–75, completed a questionnaire inside the social VR platform to measure levels of loneliness (UCLA 20-item scale) and social anxiety (17-item SPIN scale) in the social VR platform (online condition) and real world (offline condition). Subsequently, a focus group (n = 9) was conducted to gather insights into how and why participants were using the social VR platform. Findings from the questionnaire revealed significantly lower levels of loneliness and social anxiety when in the social VR platform. Lower levels of loneliness and social anxiety were also associated with participants who socialised with a regular group of friends. In addition, findings from the focus group suggested that being part of an online group facilitates stronger feelings of belonging. Social VR can be used as a valuable intervention to reduce feelings of loneliness and social anxiety. Future studies should continue to establish whether social VR can help to encourage group formation and provide people with enhanced social opportunities beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175961797"

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improves pain-related disability and quality of life, but patient access remains a challenge. We hypothesized that in-home weekly CBT coordinated with daily use of a proprietary VR toolkit will reduce pain, anxiety, and depression for patients with non-operative chronic cervical and lumbar spondylitic pain with and without radiculopathy. Methods: A total of 145 patients with chronic spondylitic pain (63 cervical, 46 noradicular lumbar, 36 radicular lumbar) were enrolled into a guided 14-week VR+CBT program (Vx Therapy) consisting of weekly encounters with a trained therapist and 50 modules. Pain/anxiety severity scores and time to pain recurrence were recorded prospectively by patients. PROMIS measures of overall daily pain intensity, behavior, interference, anxiety, and depression were recorded at baseline and conclusion of the program. Results: A total of 52% of the 145 patients were male. The average (SD) age of the cohort was 51 (10.7) years (range: 24–76 years). Mean score for all PROMIS domains were significantly improved after 14 weeks of Vx Therapy (pain intensity 36±24 vs. 28±21, interference 39±25 vs. 24±21, behavior 35±21 vs. 25±16, anxiety 51±28 vs. 41±26, depression 58±32 vs. 48±32) for the entire cohort and each diagnosis group. Virtual reality acutely reduced pain on average by 33% (4.5±2.5 vs. 6.7±2.2, p<.05) across all 14 weeks, lasting a mean 2.8 hours after use. Duration of pain relief increased by the final vs. first month (4.5 hours vs. 2.5 hours, p<.05). Virtual reality acutely reduced anxiety on average by 46% (3.5±3 vs. 6.4±2, p<.05) across all 14 weeks lasting a mean 2.7 hours after use. The effect was similar for all 3 groups. Conclusions: Fourteen weeks of a remote CBT guided in-home VR toolkit provided effective and sustained pain, anxiety, and depression relief in patients with chronic degenerative neck/back pain with and without radiculopathy. The non-invasive, non-pharmacological nature of Vx Therapy makes it an ideal option for pain management in the post-opioid epidemic era. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176926138"

Such models, when applied to architectural spaces, could pave the way for design decisions where visual attention is taken into account. In this study, we tested the performance of eleven commonly used saliency models that combine traditional and deep learning methods on 126 rendered interior scenes with associated head tracking data. The data was extracted from three experiments conducted in virtual reality between 2016 and 2018. Two of these datasets pertain to the perceptual effects of daylight and include variations of daylighting conditions for a limited set of interior spaces, thereby allowing to test the influence of light conditions on human head movement. Ground truth maps were extracted from the collected head tracking logs, and the prediction accuracy of the models was tested via the correlation coefficient between ground truth and prediction maps. To address the possible inflation of results due to the equator bias, we conducted complementary analyses by restricting the area of investigation to the equatorial image regions. Although limited to immersive virtual environments, the promising performance of some traditional models such as GBVS360eq and BMS360eq for colored and textured architectural rendered spaces offers us the prospect of their possible integration into design tools. We also observed a strong correlation in head movements for the same space lit by different types of sky, a finding whose generalization requires further investigations based on datasets more specifically developed to address this question. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174680017"

These tests involve a pre-determined sinusoidal trajectory. While there are general guidelines for the choice of amplitude and frequency for such trajectories in existing literature, there are none for smaller submerged ocean craft. The direct application of the work presented in this paper is for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). A series of two articles presents analysis of virtual planar motion mechanism (VPMM) specific to AUVs. An arbitrary selection of amplitudes and frequencies for VPMM can result in significant uncertainty in hydrodynamic derivatives. The results in this article explain the effect of frequencies and amplitudes of pure sway and pure yaw VPMM implemented in a lumped parameter maneuvering model (LPM) for the horizontal plane. This article shows that for typical AUV geometries that the use of non-dimensional frequency up to a value of 0.5 and a non-dimensional amplitude of up to 0.25 remains acceptable for pure sway and pure yaw VPMM despite fluid memory effects. For the first time, a detailed methodology to determine appropriate amplitudes and frequencies for any craft is presented, with the results of one craft shown as an example. Overall, this series of articles sheds light on the process to determine the amplitude and frequency for pure sway and pure yaw VPMM for an AUV in the early design stage. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175694754"

Resilience analysis is a powerful tool to quantify the object's (e.g., a building portfolio's) ability to withstand disruptive events. The key aspects include (1) the modeling of the recovery process in the aftermath of a cyclone event, which is intrinsically complex and is conditional on multiple factors (e.g., the available resources, the damage state immediately after a hazardous event), and (2) a reasonable index for resilience quantification that is capable of reflecting the asset owner/decision-maker's requirement for the recovery process. In this paper, a new resilience measure is proposed that incorporates a requirement of anticipated recovery time (i.e., whether the recovery can be completed before the anticipated time) for the object. A novel framework for resilience quantification of residential building portfolios is also developed, which involves an optimal resource allocation strategy to maximize the resilience of building portfolios. The applicability of the proposed framework is illustrated through examining the resilience of a virtual community subjected to cyclone winds. The impacts of resourcefulness, wind field uncertainty, and correlation between building capacities on the building portfolio resilience are investigated.  © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174415507"

Upper Palaeolithic cave art forms the most robust record for investigating this and the methods of its production, themes, and temporal and spatial changes have been researched extensively, but without consensus over its functions or meanings. More compelling arguments draw from visual psychology and posit that the immersive, dark conditions of caves elicited particular psychological responses, resulting in the perception—and depiction—of animals on suggestive features of cave walls. Our research developed and piloted a novel VR experiment that allowed participants to perceive 3D models of cave walls, with the Palaeolithic art digitally removed, from El Castillo cave (Cantabria, Spain). Results indicate that modern participants’ visual attention corresponded to the same topographic features of cave walls utilised by Palaeolithic artists, and that they perceived such features as resembling animals. Although preliminary, our results support the hypothesis that pareidolia—a product of our cognitive evolution—was a key mechanism in Palaeolithic art making, and demonstrates the potential of interdisciplinary VR research for understanding the evolution of art, and demonstrate the potential efficacy of the methodology. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175702781"

Although recent studies have informed of toxicity of various pollutants, understanding the transport and deposition characteristics of particles in lower respiratory tract is still challenging. The current study proposes a novel model to simulate flow field change from the entrance of lower respiratory tract to pulmonary acinus, while studying particle transport and deposition characteristics. This model for lower respiratory tract with several bronchial extensions containing virtual pulmonary acinus is calculated using computational fluid dynamics and dynamics mesh. The results showed that in the first 10 generations of the lower respiratory tract, vortices and gravity interfered with particles' trajectory, affecting particle deposition distribution. For the first to the tenth-generation respiratory tract, coarse particles were deposited throughout almost the whole respiratory tract model. In contrast, ultrafine particles did not deposit in the higher-generation respiratory tract. The particle enrichment ability of various lobes was uneven with three particle deposition fraction variation patterns. Virtual pulmonary acinus influenced particle deposition and distribution because of vortex ring's trapped ability during expansion and contraction. This new attempt to build a virtual pulmonary acinus model to simulate particle deposition effects in human respiratory system may provide a reference for studying the toxicities of inhalable particles in the exposed human body. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170227755"

In order to solve this problem this article is proposing AI-based next-generation sensors for enhanced rehabilitation monitoring and analysis along with other AI based automated tools. By employing precise motion recognition algorithms based on machine intelligence, these sensors accurately capture gait data from the elderly and allows the customization of individualized rehabilitation plans based on their unique needs. They offer a range of visual and auditory stimuli within virtual rehabilitative environments in order to stimulate interest and foster active engagement for enhancing the effectiveness of rehabilitation training in elderly people. Experimental results demonstrate that the rehabilitative effects achieved within virtual environments are comparable to real-world settings and exhibit successful outcomes. With the aid of this technology, adjustable lower limb exoskeleton medical equipment is designed to accommodate individual differences and rehabilitation progress. By seamlessly integrating virtual spaces and next generation smart sensors, the proposed research offer a dynamic and tangible rehabilitation solution. PGWBI score, balance ability score, gait improvement, blood pressure, heart rate and statistical metrics such as R2 score, mean value and standard deviation and confidence intervals are considered for performance evaluation of the proposed rehabilitation monitoring and analysis method. The proposed research is also addressing the challenges posed by an aging society while aligning with the goals of the information and digital era.

We tested whether manipulating PS in an iVR buffet affects the weight of food selected, and whether this response to PS is similar to participants' measured intake when PS varies at laboratory meals. In a randomized crossover design, 91 adults (18-71 y; 64 females; BMI = 25.3 ± 5.7) used their iVR remote to select lunch and dinner portions from an iVR buffet before consuming a standardized lab meal at two visits separated by one week. The PS in the iVR buffet and lab meals varied between a standard PS and a large PS. This design enabled comparisons of PS effects between iVR and lab settings, despite the scale difference in food weight between the environments. Portion size significantly affected food selection and food intake (p < 0.001). Subjects selected an additional 350 g in iVR and consumed an additional 154 g of food in the lab meals when offered the large portion compared to the small portion. The effect of PS showed a similar percentage increase in iVR (36.5%) and lab meals (39.2%). There was no significant difference in the effect of PS between iVR and lab meals after accounting for scale differences in food weight between the environments. The response to PS was not influenced by subject characteristics such as body mass index, sex, or age. These results demonstrate the utility of iVR for replicating real-world eating behaviors and enhancing our understanding of the intricate dynamics of food-related behaviors in a variety of contexts. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173799110"

To solve these problems, this study conducts a virtual landscape preference survey for both residents and potential tourists. The 10 virtual offshore wind farms’ landscape profiles were established according to four attributes: the number of turbines, arrangement of turbines, distance, and altitude. As a result, residents and potential tourists were reported to hold opposing perspectives about changing the number of turbines, the arrangement of the turbines, and the distance, though they gave the same response about changing the altitude. However, the exposure time to offshore wind farms and the number of visits to coastal areas did not affect the landscape preference of offshore wind farms. The results indicated the importance of considering both residents and potential tourists. In addition, the definite change of preference for altitude explained the necessity of new attributes that reflect the situation of coastal areas. Last, using virtual reality with 3D simulations could improve the evaluation system of offshore wind farms by reducing the temporal and spatial constraints. Thus, the results of this study could be utilized to develop offshore wind farm evaluation systems, which could reflect the opinions of residents and tourists by considering localized factors. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169799854"

However, the physical demands of mid-air movements make it difficult to use VR for extended periods. DeskVR offers a solution that allows users to engage in VR while seated at a desk, minimizing physical exhaustion. However, developing appropriate motion techniques for this context is challenging due to limited mobility and space constraints. This work focuses on object manipulation techniques, exploring touch-based and mid-air-based approaches to design a suitable solution for DeskVR, hypothesizing that touch-based object manipulation techniques could be as effective as mid-air object manipulation in a DeskVR scenario while less physically demanding. Thus, we propose Scaled Indirect Touch 6-DOF (SIT6), an indirect touch-based object manipulation technique incorporating scaled input mapping to address precision and out-of-reach manipulation issues. The implementation of our solution consists of a state machine with error-handling mechanisms and visual indicators to enhance interaction. User experiments were conducted to compare the SIT6 technique with a baseline mid-air approach, revealing comparable effectiveness while demanding less physical exertion. These results validated our hypothesis and established SIT6 as a viable option for object manipulation in DeskVR scenarios. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175143602"

Yet, current manufacturing education and training overwhelmingly continues to depend on traditional pedagogical methods that segregate theoretical studies and practical training. While educational institutes have generally improved theoretical studies, they often lack facilities and labs to properly reproduce the working environments necessary for practice. Even in industrial settings, it is difficult, if not impossible, to halt the actual production lines to train new operators. Recently, applications with extended reality (XR) technologies, such as virtual, augmented, or mixed reality, reached a mature technology readiness level. With this technological advancement, we can envision a transition to a new teaching paradigm that exploits simulated learning environments. Thus, it becomes possible to bridge the gap between theory and practice for both students and industrial trainees. This article presents a systematic literature review of the main applications of XR technologies in manufacturing education, their goals and technology readiness levels, and a comprehensive overview of the development tools and experimental strategies deployed. This review contributes: (1) a state-of-the-art description of current research in XR education for manufacturing systems, and (2) a comprehensive analysis of the technological platforms, the experimental procedures and the analytical methodologies deployed in the body of literature examined.

This study investigated Which digital tools are available to train surgical skills, How these tools are used, How effective they are, and What skills they are intended to teach. Methods: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane libraries were systematically reviewed for randomized trials, evaluating digital skill-training tools based on objective outcomes (skills scores and completion time) in surgical residents. Digital tools effectiveness were compared against controls, wet/dry lab training, and other digital tools. Tool and training factors subgroups were analysed, and studies were assessed on their primary outcomes: technical and/or non-technical. Results: The 33 included studies involved 927 residents and six digital tools; digital box trainers, (immersive) virtual reality (VR) trainers, robot surgery trainers, coaching and feedback, and serious games. Digital tools outperformed controls in skill scores (SMD 1.66 [1.06, 2.25], P < 0.00001, I2 = 83 %) and completion time (SMD -1.05 [−1.72, −0.38], P = 0.0001, I2 = 71 %). There were no significant differences between digital tools and lab training, between tools, or in other subgroups. Only two studies focussed on non-technical skills. Conclusion: While the efficacy of digital tools in enhancing technical surgical skills is evident - especially for VR-trainers -, there is a lack of evidence regarding non-technical skills, and need to improve methodological robustness of research on new (digital) tools before they are implemented in curricula. Key message: This study provides critical insight into the increasing presence of digital tools in surgical training, demonstrating their usefulness while identifying current challenges, especially regarding methodological robustness and inattention to non-technical skills. © 2023 The Authors","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174521946"

However, it remains unclear if and how the MTL represents both space and memory especially during physical navigation, given challenges associated with deep brain recordings in humans during movement.

This study examined the influence of classroom architectural design variables on musicians’ emotional and cognitive experiences during solo performance. Specifically, the effects of color and type of lighting were explored. Using immersive virtual reality technology, musicians were immersed in a virtual representation of a real conservatory classroom. Study participants were exposed to variations in room design while playing their instruments. Questionnaires were used to assess the musicians’ level of immersion in the virtual environment and to determine how design variables affected their perception of the environment and emotional state. In addition, eye tracking was used to record eye behavior during performance and to identify involuntary eye movements indicative of emotional arousal. The results of this study support the feasibility of enhancing the musician experience and reducing performance anxiety during solo performances by manipulating environmental design variables. Our research showed that the combination of daylight and window views contributed significantly to a more positive evaluation of the environment, making it appear more pleasant, open, warm and light. In contrast, the absence of daylight and no outside views not only had a negative impact on environmental ratings, but also significantly increased saccadic eye movements, which are associated with higher levels of anxiety. In addition, rooms with reddish walls and floors were perceived as warmer than those with blue or gray tones. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175469675"

A significant challenge is the disconnection between the robot sensor data and the human operator's sensory processes, creating a sensorimotor mismatch in motor-intensive activities. This disconnection is particularly challenging in motor-intensive activities that require accurate perception and response. Researchers have started investigating haptic interactions to enhance the control feedback loop, including simulating contacts, motions, and tactile input. However, although current methodologies have advanced the field, they often focused on certain aspects and could be further expanded to provide a more comprehensive simulation of the physical interaction that occurs in typical construction operations. This study designs and tests a comprehensive high-fidelity embodied teleoperation method that simulates complete real-world physical processes via the physics engine. The proposed method captures all categories of physical interaction in typical motor-intensive construction tasks, including weight, texture, inertia, impact, balance, rotation, and spring. A human-subject experiment shows that the proposed method substantially improves performance and human functions in a teleoperated pipe-fitting task. The results indicate that the proposed multisensory augmentation method significantly enhances performance and user experience, offering valuable insights for designing innovative robot teleoperation systems for future construction applications.  © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173888336"

Research has shown the potential of virtual reality (VR) for simulating real-life experiences, allowing for public speaking practice in an ecological and safe environment. This between-subjects study investigated the effect of VR on foreign language anxiety (FLA) in public speaking practice. Intermediate learners of English participated in eight public speaking sessions over a three-month period, yielding 160 research observations. The experimental intervention took place in high-immersion VR with subjects wearing a VR headset and speaking in front of virtual audience. In the control intervention, subjects used a videoconferencing platform (Zoom) to speak in front of a real-life audience. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that practicing speaking in VR was associated with statistically significant lower FLA scores, compared with speaking practice using Zoom. The study found that VR technology had a positive effect on practicing public speaking in a foreign language. The research findings have practical implications for professionals and curriculum designers in various domains where public speaking skills are essential. For example, incorporating VR-based public speaking practice can benefit professionals preparing for a job interview, an elevator pitch, or a conference presentation. Curriculum designers can consider integrating VR simulations into language courses to provide students with realistic public speaking experiences. This approach can help students overcome language barriers, reduce anxiety, and develop their communication skills in a controlled and supportive environment. © 2023, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173780476"

Fear memories can be acquired through contextual fear conditioning (CFC) which relies on the hippocampus. The thalamic nucleus reuniens (NR) is necessary to extinguish contextual fear and innervates hippocampal CA1. However, the role of the NR-CA1 pathway in contextual fear is unknown. We developed a head-restrained virtual reality CFC paradigm, and demonstrate that mice can acquire and extinguish context-dependent fear responses. We found that inhibiting the NR-CA1 pathway following CFC lengthens the duration of fearful freezing epochs, increases fear generalization, and delays fear extinction. Using in vivo imaging, we recorded NR-axons innervating CA1 and found that NR-axons become tuned to fearful freezing following CFC. We conclude that the NR-CA1 pathway actively suppresses fear by disrupting contextual fear memory retrieval in CA1 during fearful freezing behavior, a process that also reduces fear generalization and accelerates extinction. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174831072"

We used the R software version 4.2.1 to analyze the data. Results: We included a total of 20 studies, with sample sizes ranging from 60 to 570. Virtual reality was the most effective strategy for lowering pain during AC [MD = -1.30, 95% CI (-2.11, -0.49)]. In addition, paracetamol use was the most successful approach for lowering pain following AC [MD = -1.68, 95% CI (-1.99, -1.37)]. The use of H7 acupressure, however, was the strategy that significantly reduced anxiety following AC [SMD = -15.46, 95% CI (-17.77, -13.15)]. Conclusion: The most effective method for reducing pain is the combination of virtual reality with paracetamol.

Although modern robots integrated with flexible sensors can precisely detect pressure, shear force, and strain, they still perform insufficiently or require multi-sensors to respond to both static and high-frequency physical stimuli during the interaction. Here, we report a real-time artificial sensory system for high-accuracy texture recognition based on a single iontronic slip-sensor, and propose a criterion—spatiotemporal resolution, to corelate the sensing performance with recognition capability. The sensor can respond to both static and dynamic stimuli (0-400 Hz) with a high spatial resolution of 15 μm in spacing and 6 μm in height, together with a high-frequency resolution of 0.02 Hz at 400 Hz, enabling high-precision discrimination of fine surface features. The sensory system integrated on a prosthetic fingertip can identify 20 different commercial textiles with a 100.0% accuracy at a fixed sliding rate and a 98.9% accuracy at random sliding rates.

Nevertheless, it is not enough to have a model; it should be analysed by considering its components. The research objectives were to perform global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses on a dynamic mathematical model for the output variables: air temperature, thermal mass temperature, relative humidity, and accumulated lettuce biomass inside a greenhouse. The model was based on mass and energy balances at a non-steady state. The global sensitivity analysis of the model's parameters was realised using Standard Regression Coefficient (SRC), Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST), and Sobol. The first-order indices were found with the three methods, and the total effects indices were found with the EFAST and Sobol methods. The model parameters were analysed to determine their influence over the output variables. The uncertainty analysis considered the variability in the parameters, assuming a uniform distribution for each with a 20% variation from its nominal value. The Monte Carlo and Latin hypercube samplings were used with 5000 samples. The more influential parameters for air temperature were related to the physical characteristics of the greenhouse; for the thermal mass, it was found to be the soil temperature; for relative humidity and biomass, the more significant parameters were those related to the leaf area index.

Therefore, in recent years, more attention has been paid to the development of new methods for the diagnosis and treatment of patients, which can be referred to efforts made to develop new medicines and diagnostic tools. With using these tools and new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, patients' data with great accuracy are collected and analyzed; a huge transformation in the field of treatment is tacked place. The design of intelligent medical devices has a high impact on the faster recognition and treatment of patients. On the other hand, making a relationship between patients and medical devices can have a positive effect on the treatment of patients. Patients who can feel relaxed and comfortable during the treatment will put more effort into their own treatment. A smart medical device, which has a friendly user interface with the patient, has a positive role in the treatment of patients. Patient experience is a part of user experience that describes the interaction between patients and medical devices. In the concept of patient experiences, the experience of illness and also the way of healthcare are examined. So, the role of human-machine interaction (HMI) systems should not be ignored in the field of treatment. In the field of treatment, HMI refers to facilitating communication between humans and machines. So, the goal of the designing system based on HMI is important to encourage patients to seek treatment and give them hope for life during their treatment period according to their age conditions. For example, the patient's age is an important criterion that should be considered in the design of a human-computer interaction system. Also, the gender of patients plays a role in communicating between patients and medical devices. On other hand, the role of artificial intelligence in designing human-computer interaction systems cannot be ignored. This type of system can prevent disease by checking the patient's condition, predicting the patient's condition during the treatment period based on the patient's personality, and also can decide using decision-making systems. Also, recommender systems can use intelligent medical devices to treat patients according to the predictions made. Accurate diagnosis of medical devices according to the physical and mental conditions of the patient is an important point that affects HMI systems. Actually, an HMI system should be able to identify patients' mental states by using powerful sensors and facial image processing in order to be a user-friendly interface for the medical system. In this chapter, various factors and their solutions that can play a role in the design of an HMI system are examined. © 2024 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

We have recently reported our use of virtual reality (VR) to alleviate the fear and anxiety experienced during oral surgical procedures However, the effectiveness of VR in alleviating anxiety varies greatly between individuals. We therefore investigated whether the content of the VR presentation made any difference to its effect in alleviating anxiety, and whether it had any analgesic effect. The study subjects experienced one of two different types of VR presentation and were asked to complete a questionnaire about any changes in their anxiety during the procedure, including a visual analog scale (VAS) score. As an objective evaluation, changes in pain threshold during the VR presentation were investigated using PainVision. For those patients who experienced a presentation showing a natural landscape, the change in VAS score was − 13.3 ± 28.7 mm, whereas for those who experienced a presentation showing a video game the change was − 22.2 ± 32.1 mm, an even greater reduction. In a pain questionnaire completed by individuals who had experienced the video game presentations, approximately 70% reported that their pain had diminished. An objective evaluation of pain threshold also showed that the pain threshold of individuals increased by around 3% while experiencing the natural landscape VR presentation, but that while experiencing the video game presentation, it increased significantly by around 15% compared with baseline. These results show that the content of the presentation affected not only the rate of decrease in anxiety, but also the pain threshold. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177472470"

Recent research has demonstrated that this uniqueness makes brand names and logotypes susceptible to counterfeiting through misspelling by transposition in tasks that require participants to identify correct spellings. However, our understanding of how brand names are incidentally processed when presented as logotypes is incomplete. To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a virtual reality experiment to explore the transposed-letter confusability effect on brand name recognition. Participants were immersed in a virtual reality setting and incidentally exposed to logotypes that had correctly spelled brand names or included letter transpositions. Offline analyses revealed that participants were more accurate at recognizing brand names that had been presented with correct spellings than those that had been misspelled. Furthermore, participants exhibited false memories for misspelled logotypes, recalling them as if they had been spelled correctly. Thus, our findings revealed that the incidental processing of misspelled logotypes (e.g., SASMUNG) affects the accuracy of logotype identity recognition, thereby underscoring the challenges faced by individuals when identifying brand names and the elements that make counterfeits so effective. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174543407"

The VR platform offers a unique perspective to connect patients with places and experiences they might otherwise miss. This rapid review aims to present the current literature on the uses and benefits of VR for palliative care and hospice patients. Through a systematic process, we identified 14 articles published between 2018 and 2023 that used VR as an interventional strategy for symptom management. The VR equipment includes a head-mounted display, such as the Oculus Go, and sometimes requires hand controllers or joysticks. Virtual reality software was contained exclusively in the head-mounted displays or required a laptop. Nature scenes, memorable locations, and the solar system are examples of options patients could select for the VR experience. Assessments of the intervention were measured before, during, after, and several hours afterward to evaluate benefits and potential adverse effects. Pain was the predominant symptom assessed in the studies. Overall, most of the studies focused on establishing the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of VR using a single-arm interventional method. Future research should implement randomized controlled trials, increase sample size, and expand to pediatric populations. Copyright © 2023 by The Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association.

However, TEL-based systems tend to work isolated from one another, focus on different skills, and fail to provide contents without a sound pedagogical background. Objective: The objective of this descriptive study is to present in detail EASIER, an innovative TEL platform for surgical and interventional training, as well as the results of its validation. Methods: EASIER provides a Learning Management System (LMS) for institutions and content creators that can connect and integrate TEL “external assets” (virtual reality simulators, augmented box trainers, augmented videos, etc.) addressing different skills. The platform integrates all skills under an Assessment Module that measures skills’ progress in different courses. Finally, it provides content creators with a pedagogical model to scaffold contents while retaining flexibility to approach course design with different training philosophies in mind. Three courses were developed and hosted in the platform to validate it with end-users in terms of usability, performance, learning results in the courses and student self-perception on learning. Results: In total 111 volunteers completed the validation. The study was limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which limited access to external assets (virtual reality simulators). Nevertheless, usability was rated with 73.1 in the System Usability Scale. Most positive aspects on performance were easiness to access the platform, easiness to change the configuration and not requiring additional plug-ins to use the platform. The platform was rated above average in the six scales of the User Experience Questionnaire. Overall, student results improved significantly across the three courses (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This study provides, within its limitations, evidence on the usefulness of the EASIER platform for distance learning of MIS skills. Results show the potential impact of the platform and are an encouraging boost for the future, especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175241260"

In virtual reality, conflicts can arise between the eye height in the real world and the eye height simulated in a VR application. We hypothesized that participants would be influenced more by variation in simulated eye height when they had a clear expectation about their eye height in the real world such as when sitting or standing, and less so when they did not have a clear estimate of the distance between their eyes and the real-life ground plane, e.g., when lying supine. Using virtual reality, 40 participants compared the height of a red square simulated at three different distances (6, 12, and 18 m) against the length of a physical stick (38.1 cm) held in their hands. They completed this task in all combinations of four real-life postures (supine, sitting, standing, standing on a table) and three simulated eye heights that corresponded to each participant’s real-world eye height (123cm sitting; 161cm standing; 201cm on table; on average). Confirming previous results, the square’s perceived size varied inversely with simulated eye height. Variations in simulated eye height affected participants’ perception of size significantly more when sitting than in the other postures (supine, standing, standing on a table). This shows that real-life posture can influence the perception of size in VR. However, since simulated eye height did not affect size estimates less in the lying supine than in the standing position, our hypothesis that humans would be more influenced by variations in eye height when they had a reliable estimate of the distance between their eyes and the ground plane in the real world was not fully confirmed. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177077612"

Here, we test the hypothesis that biopsychosocial factors including typical drinking pattern and expectancy that alcohol enhances social interactions would moderate this effect. Methods: We assessed the drinking topography (DT) of participants (N=20) in a VR environment with a programmable VB during two testing sessions: one with a fast-drinking VB (30–60 s sip interval) and one in which the VB drank slowly (60–120 s sip interval). In this secondary analysis, linear mixed models were used to characterize potential interactions of typical daily alcohol intake (quantity-frequency index [QFI]), maximal alcohol consumed in one bout over the past six months (maxQ), Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) score, and expectancy that alcohol enhances social and physical pleasures (SPP) with time in simulation and condition on sip interval and volume. Results: Individuals with higher MaxQ showed a reduced effect of time on sip volume such that more intense recent binge episodes were associated with consistent drinking. Greater AUDIT scores were associated with lower sip intervals. In addition, greater SPP expectancy was associated with higher sip volumes, but only in the fast-drinking VB condition. Conclusions: Greater drinking behavior and social expectancies were associated with more rapid drinking topography. In addition, findings suggest challenging alcohol outcome expectancies related to social enhancement could reduce alcohol-related risks by slowing the rate of alcohol intake in social situations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177496852"

Developments such as the COVID-19 pandemic and new IT platforms like the metaverse have spurred a host of new immersive social applications that are accessed through head-mounted displays. This is expected to stimulate a surge in research on extended reality–supported collaborative learning (XRCL) which refers to distributed collaboration situations where immersive technology such as head-mounted displays are used as a medium for collaborative learning. The primary aim of this article is to critically examine the potential pedagogical benefits and limitations of using XRCL with the objective of developing a theoretical framework that describes the fundamental factors that make immersive collaborative learning unique: the theory of immersive collaborative learning (TICOL). In TICOL, we propose that technological features, social affordances, and pedagogical techniques can foster four psychological factors that we define as fundamentally different in XRCL compared to collaboration that occurs through traditional systems (e.g., laptops): social presence, physical presence, body ownership, and agency. These are central factors that we hypothesize can transform the processes and contexts of collaboration through their influence on the quality of cognitive and socio-emotional social interaction, the social space, and ultimately learning outcomes. Since XRCL research is in its infancy, we hope that TICOL can provide a theoretical basis for developing the field by motivating researchers to empirically challenge and build on our hypotheses and ultimately develop a deeper understanding of if and how immersive media influences collaborative learning. © 2023, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175233061"

We performed a systematic review of the literature with a narrative synthesis, to examine the current evidence for VR in simulation-based emergency skills training. We broadly define emergency skills as any clinical skill used in the emergency care of patients across all clinical settings. Methods: This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Cochrane's Rob 2 and ROBVIS tools were used during study quality assessment. No ethical review was required for this work. Results: Thirty-four articles published between 14th March 1998 and 1st March 2022 were included in this review. Studies were predominantly conducted in the USA and Europe and focussed on a variety of healthcare disciplines including medical, nursing, and allied health. VR education was delivered using head-mounted displays, Cave Automatic Virtual Environment systems, and bespoke setups. These systems delivered education in a variety of areas (emergency medicine, equipment training, obstetrics, and basic/advanced life support). Subjective potential advantages of this technology included realism, replayability, and time-effectiveness. Reports of adverse events were low in frequency across the included studies. Whilst clear educational benefit was generally noted, this was not reflected in changes to patient-based outcomes. Conclusion: There may be educational benefit to using VR in the context of simulation-based emergency skills training including knowledge gain and retention, skill performance, acceptability, usability, and validity. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate clear cost-effectiveness, or direct improvement of patient or institutional outcomes, at this stage. © 2023 The Author(s)","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174695089"

To address this issue, we aimed to develop a virtual platform for combined spinal-epidural anesthesia that merges virtual reality technology with haptic feedback technology, while assessing its educational impact and learning outcomes. Methods: We utilized MIMICS, 3Ds MAX, and UNITY 3D software to perform 3D reconstruction based on lumbar CT/MRI data from a standard male volunteer. The haptic coefficients were configured on each layer by 20 experienced anesthesiologists in accordance with the Geomagic Touch X force feedback device. A total of 20 anesthesiology interns completed 30 virtual puncture training sessions. Two experienced anesthetists evaluated the efficacy of the platform and the level of mastery achieved using the Global Rating Scale (GRS) and a Checklist score, respectively. Finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted to gather feedback on the virtual platform. Results: After the 10th session, the puncture time stabilized at 2.4 min. As the number of sessions increased, the Global Rating Scale (GRS) score stabilized by the 8th session, and the Checklist scores tended to stabilize by the 10th session. Results from questionnaires indicated that over half of the anesthesiology interns (70%) believed that the platform, which exhibited strong repeatability, improved their anatomical recognition and provided a strong sense of breakthrough in identifying the ligamentum flavum. The majority of them (80%) expressed satisfaction with the virtual platform.

The homogenized stochastic behavior of the studied unidirectional composite material is first characterized through full-field simulations on stochastic volume elements (SVEs) of the material microstructure, permitting to capture the effect of the microstructural geometric uncertainties on the material response. Then, in order to conduct the stochastic nonlinear multiscale simulations, the microscale problem is substituted by a pressure-dependent MFH reduced order micromechanical model, that is, a MF-ROM, whose properties are identified by an inverse process from the full-field SVE realizations. Homogenized stress-strain curves can be used for the identification process of the nonlinear range, however, a loss of size objectivity is encountered once the strain softening onset is reached. This work addresses this problematic introducing a calibration of the energy release rate obtained with a nonlocal MFH micromechanical model, allowing to scale the variability found on each SVE failure characteristics to the macroscale. The obtained random effective properties are then used as input of a data-driven stochastic model to generate the complete random fields used to feed the stochastic MF-ROM. To show the consistency of the methodology, two MF-ROM constructed from SVEs of two different sizes are successively considered.

The implementation of the energy release rate calibration allows to conduct stochastic studies on the failure characteristics of material samples without the need for costly experimental campaigns, paving the way for more complete and affordable virtual testing. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169167151"

This study aimed to investigate the effect of VR on pain, kinesiophobia, and function in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods: This randomized controlled trial was performed on patients who had TKA due to osteoarthritis at Gazi University Hospital from October 2019 to August 2021. For this study, 21 female TKA patients were divided into two groups by the blocked randomization method: VR (n = 10) and exercise (n = 11). The exercise group was given a home exercise program. The VR group received immersive VR application in addition to the exercise. Pain, kinesiophobia, pain catastrophizing, knee range of motion, functional status, and quality of life were assessed. The Wilcoxon Test and Mann–Whitney U Test were used for comparison of the results. Results: The VR group had a statistically significant difference in the intensity of pain at rest, at night, and during the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), kinesiophobia, pain catastrophizing, active knee flexion, the TUG, and the stair-climb test scores (P = 0.005 (95% confidence interval (CI) (−5.000, −1.000)), P = 0.005 (95% CI (−7.000, −2.000)), P = 0.023 (95% CI (−4.000, 0)), P = 0.006 (95% CI (−15.000, −3.000)), P = 0.012 (95% CI (−19.000, −3.000)), P = 0.010 (95% CI (4.000, 17.333)), P = 0.017 (95% CI (−14.700, −0.850)), P = 0.011 (95% CI (−23.100, −1.000)), respectively). Conclusion: In the early period following total knee arthroplasty, using virtual reality integrated with exercise helps to reduce pain, kinesiophobia and pain catastrophizing, and to improve functional outcomes in female patients. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175426721"

The proposed method uses generative models, such as variational auto-encoders and long short-term memory neural networks. First, a number of static receivers are modeled within a given room, covering a representative area where listeners can typically be found. Then, a BRIR is simulated in each receiver, and from them, more BRIRs uniformly distributed in the scenario are synthesized through a data augmentation procedure. In the sequel, by applying an unsupervised model to cluster the receivers positionally, the BRIRs are organized into groups. Furthermore, variational autoencoder training is performed to reduce computational complexity. The results when comparing the reconstructed BRIRs with the original ones show that the error is within the just noticeable difference threshold. A computational cost analysis in terms of the total number of operations is carried out, achieving a computational gain of over 75%, and a storage reduction of more than 99% with respect to classic BRIR generation techniques. This opens the possibility of obtaining a reliable real-time auralization with a moving receiver inside the room. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176282843"

Here, a control system at either hardware or software level is connected to a simulation model which behaves in a way reasonably similar to the real plant concerned. To date, however, VC has been used primarily by big companies only: it has not yet established itself as a standard method for SMEs. In this comprehensive review, the scientific approaches to VC have been analysed and categorised. The aim here is to give an exhaustive overview of the current state-of-the-art; to present the relevant critical challenges and to discuss current approaches. To this end, the entire spectrum of VC topics is considered. First, the technological implementation of VC is introduced. Then, the model building process is explained comprehensively, including plant analysis, finding a suitable depth of modelling and techniques for both behaviour and kinematic modelling. Based on this, methods are discussed that aim to reduce the effort involved in model creation, such as physics-based simulation and approaches to (semi-) automatic model creation. Next, the central role of VC models is presented. This is in order to discuss the potential for using cross-discipline, lifecycle-wide models from the early development phase right through to a simulation-based, digital twin.

The degree-of-freedom (DoF) is often limited, especially for its usage as a holographic optical element in imaging or display systems, as what is recorded is what to use. In this work, based on the emerging self-assembled photo-aligned liquid crystal, a polarization hologram with full DoF for local manipulation of optical structure is demonstrated. The ability to record an arbitrary wavefront (in-plane DoF) is achieved by freeform surface exposure, while the local adjustment of deposited liquid crystal (out-of-plane DoF) is realized by inkjet printing. The methodology for designing and fabricating such a hologram is exemplified by building a full-color retinal scanning display without color crosstalk. Here, the arbitrary wavefront modulation capability helps to eliminate the aberrations caused by mismatched exposure and display wavelengths. The local liquid crystal adjustment ability enables the suppression of crosstalk by variation of chiral pitch and film thickness to tune the peak and valley of Bragg diffraction band. The demonstrated method is expected to greatly impact the fields of advanced imaging and display, such as augmented reality and virtual reality, that require optics with an ultrathin form factor and high degrees of design freedom simultaneously. © 2023, Chinese Society for Optical Engineering.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174209814"

In particular, EEG microstates translate the temporal dynamics of neuronal networks throughout the brain. Their alteration may reflect transdiagnostic anomalies in neurophysiological functions that are impaired in mood, psychosis, and autism spectrum disorders, such as sensorimotor integration, speech, sleep, and sense of self. The main questions this study aims to answer are as follows: 1) Are EEG microstate anomalies associated with clinical and functional prognosis, both in resting conditions and during sleep, across psychiatric disorders? 2) Are EEG microstate anomalies associated with differences in sensorimotor integration, speech, sense of self, and sleep? 3) Can the dynamic of EEG microstates be modulated by a non-drug intervention such as light hypnosis? Methods: This prospective cohort will include a population of adolescents and young adults, aged 15 to 30 years old, with ultra-high-risk of psychosis (UHR), first-episode psychosis (FEP), schizophrenia (SCZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), as well as healthy controls (CTRL) (N = 21 × 6), who will be assessed at baseline and after one year of follow-up. Participants will undergo deep phenotyping based on psychopathology, neuropsychological assessments, 64-channel EEG recordings, and biological sampling at the two timepoints. At baseline, the EEG recording will also be coupled to a sensorimotor task and a recording of the characteristics of their speech (prosody and turn-taking), a one-night polysomnography, a self-reference effect task in virtual reality (only in UHR, FEP, and CTRL). An interventional ancillary study will involve only healthy controls, in order to assess whether light hypnosis can modify the EEG microstate architecture in a direction opposite to what is seen in disease. Discussion: This transdiagnostic longitudinal case–control study will provide a multimodal neurophysiological assessment of clinical dimensions (sensorimotor integration, speech, sleep, and sense of self) that are disrupted across mood, psychosis, and autism spectrum disorders. It will further test the relevance of EEG microstates as dimensional functional biomarkers.

The hippocampus plays a key role for this map by linking multimodal sensory information with spatial memory representations. However, in human navigation studies, the full range of sensory information is often unavailable due to the stationarity of experimental setups. We investigated the contribution of multisensory information to memory-guided spatial navigation by presenting a virtual version of the Morris water maze on a screen and in an immersive mobile virtual reality setup. Patients with hippocampal lesions and matched controls navigated to memorized object locations in relation to surrounding landmarks. Our results show that availability of multisensory input improves memory-guided spatial navigation in both groups. It has distinct effects on navigational behaviour, with greater improvement in spatial memory performance in patients. We conclude that congruent multisensory information shifts computations to extrahippocampal areas that support spatial navigation and compensates for spatial navigation deficits. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176412586"

Due to the stochastic nature of glass, governed by microscopical surface flaws, glass plates exhibit large variations in fracture strength. The aim of this work is to propose a new strength prediction model for glass, named the Glass Strength Prediction Model (GSPM) that captures the nature of fracture initiation in glass, spanning from rate dependence to size effects. We aim for the presented model to be applicable in modern design processes and provide a procedure to facilitate input parameter calibration for glass plates from different suppliers. GSPM is a Monte-Carlo based model that combines the theories of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and sub-critical crack growth (SCG) to generate virtual tests on a representative sample of glass plates. The stress evolution in the glass plates is obtained from finite element (FE) simulations. The model results in representative fracture strength distributions that span the probable fracture initiation instances with respect to time, location and stress level. We also demonstrate how the GSPM can be used to trigger fracture in constitutive models applied in FE simulations. This feature provides the option to investigate scenarios including multiple glass plates with interdependent fracture initiation behavior. The GSPM displays great promise in terms of usability and prediction capacity. It is able to capture the fracture initiation behavior of glass plates of varying geometries exposed to load cases spanning from, e.g., quasi-static four-point bending to blast pressure. The model has the potential to reduce the number of physical experiments and numerical FE simulations in modern development processes of glass structures. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175445100"

Specifically, we examine the effectiveness of haptic, visual, and verbal modalities in enhancing the learning process. Our user study results reveal that trainees were able to replicate movements more accurately when given instructions using the visual modality, and they were able to replicate movements faster when given instructions using the haptic modality. While verbal instructions increased the sense of copresence with the teacher, it was the least preferred modality. These findings suggest that multimodality could be the most appropriate approach to enhance the teaching of movement amplitude skills.

Short- and long-term outcomes regarding self-reported symptoms in the spider phobia questionnaire (SPQ) and final patient-spider distance in the behavioral avoidance test (BAT) were predicted via logistic regression models with the corresponding baseline score, age, initial fear activation, within-session fear reduction and fear expectancy violation as predictors. To predict long-term remission status at 6-month-follow-up, dimensional short-term changes in the SPQ and BAT were additionally included. Higher within-session fear reductions predicted better treatment outcomes (long-term SPQ; short- and long-term BAT). Lower initial fear activation tended to be associated with better long-term outcomes (SPQ), while fear expectancy violation was not associated with any outcome measure. Short-term change in the SPQ predicted remission status. Findings highlight that in VRET for spider phobia, the experience of fear reduction is central for short- and long-term treatment success and should be focused by therapists. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174856573"

In this study, we designed a robust and intelligent IoMT system through the synergistic integration of flexible wearable triboelectric sensors and deep learning-assisted data analytics. We embedded four triboelectric sensors into a wristband to detect and analyze limb movements in patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease (PD). By further integrating deep learning-assisted data analytics, we actualized an intelligent healthcare monitoring system for the surveillance and interaction of PD patients, which includes location/trajectory tracking, heart monitoring and identity recognition. This innovative approach enabled us to accurately capture and scrutinize the subtle movements and fine motor of PD patients, thus providing insightful feedback and comprehensive assessment of the patients’ conditions.

A crucial preliminary step for developing optimized VR-based applications for rehabilitation purposes is identifying potential interventions to meet the requirements necessary to satisfy end-users’ needs. This study aims to assess the acceptability, usability, and appropriateness of a VR physical therapy program executed with Oculus Quest 2 by expert physiotherapists of shoulder musculoskeletal rehabilitation. Methods: Eleven physiotherapists were enrolled to test a VR program for shoulder musculoskeletal rehabilitation. At the end of each session, physiotherapists completed three questionnaires about the acceptability, usability, and appropriateness of the VR system and application, investigating aspects such as wearability, safety, stability, ease of control, comfort, size, utility, playability, and use mode. Results: The acceptability questionnaire revealed that all the physiotherapists found the VR system easy to wear and control, very confident, and safe. The usability questionnaire showed that most physiotherapists (73%) found the VR application entertaining, although only 45% said the system could be used independently by patients without the support of a therapist. Many physiotherapists found the use of the VR application appropriate for patients with rotator cuff tears treated conservatively (63.6%) or surgically (54.5%), for patients with shoulder osteoarthritis treated conservatively (72.7%), for patients with shoulder osteoarthritis after surgical treatment (63.6%). 91% of physiotherapists think it would be best for patients to use the VR system under the supervision of a therapist and not independently in a home setting. Conclusions: The use of VR in orthopaedic rehabilitation is encouraging, although further efforts are needed to increase the independent use of patients without the supervision of a physiotherapist. Moreover, future studies should strive to ensure the clinical effectiveness of VR rehabilitation in reaching therapeutic goal settings. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175737487"

One of the key tasks in this field is the generation of realistic talking facial videos from audio and head pose information, which has significant applications in human–computer interaction, virtual reality, and video production. However, previous work has limitations such as the inability to generate natural head poses or interact with audio, which compromises the realism and expressive power of the generated videos. This paper aims to address these issues and improve the state-of-the-art in this field. To this end, we propose an autoregressive generation method called Flow2Flow and collect a large-scale in-the-wild solo-singing-themed audio-visual dataset called AVVS to investigate the rhythmic head movement patterns. The Flow2Flow model involves a multimodal transformer block with cross-attention, which can encode audio features and historical head poses to establish potential audio-visual motion entanglement and uses normalizing flows to generate future facial motion representation sequences. The generated motion representations are identity-independent, allowing the method to be transferred to any face identity. We model the motion of image content using warping flows generated from 3D keypoints based on the facial motion representation sequences, carefully manipulate animation generation, and estimate dense motion fields based on deformation flows using a neural rendering model to present photo-realistic talking facial videos. Experimental results show that our proposed method generates photo-realistic videos with natural head poses and lip-syncing, and we validate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173990317"

The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in kinematics and injury risks between average female and male anthropometry in two exemplary use cases. A simulation study comprising the newly introduced VIVA+ human body models (HBM) was performed for two use cases. The first use case relates to whiplash associated disorders sustained in rear impacts and the second to femur fractures in pedestrians impacted by passenger cars as field data indicates that females have higher injury risk compared to males in these scenarios. Detailed seat models and a generic vehicle exterior were used to simulate crash scenarios close to those currently tested in consumer information tests. In the evaluations with one of the vehicle seats and one car shape the injury risks were equal for both models. However, the risk of the average female HBM for whiplash associated disorders was 1.5 times higher compared to the average male HBM for the rear impacts in the other seat and 10 times higher for proximal femur fractures in the pedestrian impacts for one of the two evaluated vehicle shapes.

Understanding these perceptual differences can inform designers on how to adapt content when transitioning between these two spatial computing platforms. In this paper, we conducted two psychophysical experiments to measure the perceptual thresholds of size discrimination for virtual objects. Our results indicated that users are more sensitive to size changes in VR than in video see-through AR, suggesting that size differences are easier to be perceived in VR than in AR. Additionally, for increase or decrease of sizes, the accuracy of judgments showed an asymmetric trend in video see-through AR. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174914542"

To entirely reveals the dynamic contact process, the SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) method is applied to virtual experiments to avoid the time-consuming and high costs in real experiments due to scale. In particular, an interface force model is proposed to completely describe the dynamic contact between the cold spray particles (CS particles) and substrate, which has the ability to eliminate the unphysical SPH particle penetration, rebounding phenomenon, and insufficient momentum transfer. The variation of the steady mean temperature of the CS particle surface with the initial velocity is analyzed and the critical velocity of particle deposition is successfully predicted. Furthermore, the effect of particle shapes on the deposition is discussed, which shows that the circular particles are more favourable to be deposited than the elliptical ones. The cold spray SPH model with the novel dynamic contact developed in this paper is in favor of understanding the mechanism of CS particles deposition and guiding the cold spray processes in a certain extent. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174044886"

As it is currently unknown whether a short training session of mediolateral weight-shifting in a virtual reality (VR) environment can improve weight-shifting, we investigated this question and also probed the impact of practice on brain activity. Forty healthy older adults were randomly allocated to a training (EXP, n = 20, age = 70.80 (65–77), 9 females) or a control group (CTR, n = 20, age = 71.65 (65–82), 10 females). The EXP performed a 25-min weight-shift training in a VR-game, whereas the CTR rested for the same period. Weight-shifting speed in both single- (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions was determined before, directly after, and 24 h after intervention. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) assessed the oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) levels in five cortical regions of interest. Weight-shifting in both ST and DT conditions improved in EXP but not in CTR, and these gains were retained after 24 h. Effects transferred to wider limits of stability post-training in EXP versus CTR. HbO2 levels in the left supplementary motor area were significantly increased directly after training in EXP during ST (change < SEM), and in the left somatosensory cortex during DT (change > SEM).

Methods: Thirty healthy adults (age: 21 ± 1 years; height: 166.5 ± 7.3 cm; mass: 71.7 ± 16.2 kg) were tested for postural stability in a virtual moving room paradigm (Vroom). The Vroom consisted of randomized virtual and visual perturbations of the virtual room moving toward and away from the individual, during both unexpected and expected trials. Objective postural sway variables and subjective experiences to VR using the simulator sickness questionnaire as well as balance confidence scale were also assessed and analyzed using a two way (2 × 2 [2 moving room direction (Toward vs. Away) and 2 knowledge of moving room (unexpected vs. expected)] repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), and a one-way repeated measures ANOVA and paired sample t-test, respectively at an alpha level of 0.05. Results: Significantly greater postural sway was observed when the virtual room moved toward the participant than when moving away, and when it moved unexpectedly, compared with the expected moving room. Significantly improved balance confidence with realistic immersion and without simulator sickness was also observed. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence indicating that the virtual moving room induces postural perturbations that challenge the postural control system, especially when the moving room is unexpected and moves toward the individual. Additionally, increased balance confidence and realistic immersion in the virtual environment with no adverse effects of simulator sickness were observed, providing evidence for the beneficial effects of the Vroom. Thus, the Vroom can be an easy and cost-effective method to expose individuals to realistic, virtual, and visual perturbations that challenge the postural control system and increase balance confidence, with realistic immersion and without adverse effects. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176605737"

BACKGROUND: Superior teamwork in the operating room (OR) is associated with improved technical performance and clinical outcomes. iVR can successfully train OR staff individually; however, iVR team training has yet to be investigated. METHODS: Forty participants were randomized to individual or team iVR training. Individually trained participants practiced alongside virtual avatar counterparts, whereas teams trained live in pairs. Both groups underwent 5 iVR training sessions over 6 weeks. Subsequently, they completed a real-life assessment in which they performed anterior approach total hip arthroplasty surgery on a high-fidelity model with real equipment in a simulated OR. Teams performed together, and individually trained participants were randomly paired up. Videos were marked by 2 blinded assessors recording the 'Non-Operative Technical Skills for Surgeons, Oxford NOn-TECHnical Skills II and Scrub Practitioners' List of Intraoperative Non-Technical Skills' scores. Secondary outcomes were procedure duration and the number of technical errors. RESULTS: Teams outperformed individually trained participants for nontechnical skills in the real-world assessment (Non-Operative Technical Skills for Surgeons: 13.1±1.5 vs 10.6±1.6, P = 0.002, Non-TECHnical Skills II score: 51.7 ± 5.5 vs 42.3 ± 5.6, P = 0.001 and Scrub Practitioners' List of Intraoperative Non-Technical Skills: 10 ± 1.2 vs 7.9 ± 1.6, P = 0.004).

Data were collected from March 2022 to January 2023. The experimental group received the MFU BLiS VR, in addition to traditional teaching, while the control group received only traditional teaching. Data analysis employed descriptive statistics, Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U test, and Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Results: “MFU BLiS VR” provided a learning experience in out-of-hospital basic life support for adult patients in four scenarios: (1) a person who was not breathing but had a pulse; (2) a person who was not breathing, had no pulse, and required defibrillation; (3) a person who was not breathing, had no pulse, and did not require defibrillation; and (4) a person with normal breathing and pulse but was unconscious. Each scenario was presented sequentially from scenario one to scenario four. The scenarios encompassed common and complex situations requiring prompt and effective bystander responses to save lives. The results revealed that the experimental group had a significantly shorter no-flow time compared to the control group (Z = -5.02, p <.001) and achieved significantly higher knowledge scores than the control group (Z = -3.39, p <.01) as well as superior practical skills (Z = -7.26, p <.001). Both groups reported the highest satisfaction levels in all aspects, with no significant differences. Conclusion: MFU BLiS VR is an effective training approach for teaching and learning basic life support and the use of an automated electronic defibrillator. It captures students’ attention and enhances their understanding of these essential life support skills, which are crucial for everyone. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174532010"

This research uses immersive virtual reality (VR) technology as a training device to help narrow the existing knowledge gaps in CQ scholarly literature and corporate diversity training. A VR head-mounted device was used to capture qualitative and quantitative data from participants to conduct a mixed methods study. After participants engaged in the virtual simulation, a method triangulation approach - using deductive thematic analysis, word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and correlational analysis - was used to draw conclusions from their reflections on CQ development. Results revealed a convergence of participant statements, sentiments, and CQ scores. In addition, the emerging themes aligned with the behavioral, cognitive, and motivational dimensions of the CQ construct. A fourth theme - VR experience - also emerged from participant reflections. Sentiments concerning their immersive experience in VR were largely positive. Lastly, the quantitative scores obtained by administering the CQ measurement scale showed a high motivational CQ score indicating participant eagerness to continue engaging in the VR environment. The topical themes that emerged from this study offer theoretical contributions and practical guidelines for CQ scholars, management researchers interested in exploring VR, and corporate training managers. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174312196"

Therefore, exploring the use of alternative hands-free methods for selection is essential to overcome usability problems and provide natural interaction for users. The results and insights gained from this exploration can lead to enhanced user experiences in VR applications. This study aims to contribute to the literature with the evaluation of the usability of the most commonly used hands-free methods for selection and system control tasks in immersive VR and their impact on standard and validated experience and usability metrics, namely the sense of presence, cybersickness, system usability, workload, and user satisfaction. A Fitts’ selection task was performed using a within-subjects design by nine participants experienced in VR. The methods evaluated were the handheld controllers, the head gaze, eye gaze, and voice commands for pointing at the targets, and dwell time and voice commands to confirm the selections. Results show that the methods provide similar levels of sense of presence and low cybersickness while showing low workload values and high user satisfaction, matching the experience of traditional handheld controllers for non-multimodal approaches. The assisted eye gaze with dwell was the preferred hands-free method and the one with the highest values of usability. Still, developers should minimize the number of gaze movements to reduce fatigue. The evaluation also showed that using a multimodal approach for selections, especially using the voice, decreases user satisfaction and increases users’ frustration. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174237516"

Currently, nonface-to-face DR education predominantly relies on two-dimensional (2D) videos, highlighting the need for developing educational resources that address the inherent limitations of this method. We developed a virtual reality (VR) learning medium using 360° video with a prefabricated head-mounted display (pHMD) for nonface-to-face DR learning and compared it with a 2D video medium. Methods: Forty-four participants were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 23; 2D video) and an experimental group (n = 21; 360° VR). DR was re-enacted by the operator and recorded using 360° video. A survey was performed to assess learning satisfaction and self-efficacy. The nonparametric statistical tests comparing the groups were conducted using SPSS statistical analysis software. Results: Learners in the experimental group could experience VR for DR by attaching their smartphones to the pHMD. The 360° VR video with pHMD provided a step-by-step guide for DR learning from the point of view of an operator as VR. Learning satisfaction and self-efficacy were statistically significantly higher in the experimental group than the control group (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The 360° VR videos were associated with greater learning satisfaction and self-efficacy than conventional 2D videos. However, these findings do not necessarily substantiate the educational effects of this medium, but instead suggest that it may be considered a suitable alternative for DR education in a nonface-to-face environment. However, further examination of the extent of DR knowledge gained in a nonface-to-face setting is warranted. Future research should aim to develop simulation tools based on 3D objects and also explore additional uses of 360° VR videos as prepractical learning mediums. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176348292"

As naturalness hinges on both technological and human influence factors, fine-tuning the former while assessing the latter can be used to increase overall experience. This paper investigates a reach-grab-place task inside VR using two input modalities (hand-tracking vs. handheld-controller). Subjects (N = 33) compared the two input methods available on a consumer grade VR headset for their effects on objective user performance and subjective experience of the perceived sense of presence, cognitive workload, and ease-of-use. We found that virtual hands (with hand-tracking) did not influence the subjective feelings of perceived presence, naturalness, & engagement; neither did it inspire the overall ease-of-use while performing the task. In fact, subjects completed the task faster and felt a lower mental workload and higher overall usability with handheld-controllers. The result found that in this particular case, hand-tracking did not improve the psychological and emotional determinants of immersive VR experiences. The study helps expand on our understanding of the two input modalities in terms of their viability for naturalistic experiences in VR akin to real-world scenarios. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174840649"

The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationships among visual landscape factors and soundscape evaluation of old residential areas and determine their main influencing factors. In Tianjin, China, six typical old residential areas were selected to collect sound and video information. Virtual reality (VR) was used to create an evaluation environment, and subjective evaluations of the visual landscape and soundscape were accessed through questionnaire (N = 256). The results show that the evaluation of soundscape and visual landscape satisfaction of the central square in the old residential area is superior to that of the public space along the street, as affected by spatial location, sound characteristics and other factors. Greenery satisfaction, environmental cleanliness, and architectural aesthetics were significantly positively correlated with soundscape evaluation. Additionally, three latent variables, namely, visual landscape factors, spatial factors and soundscape evaluation factors, were identified through factor analysis, and a structural equation model (SEM) of “visual landscape factors–soundscape evaluation” was built. The visual landscape factors in old residential areas were found to be important factors affecting soundscape evaluation. The standardization coefficient was 0.46 (P ≤ 0.01). Although the spatial factors have no direct contribution to the soundscape evaluation of the old residential areas, its observation variable, environmental cleanliness, is significantly positively correlated with all the observed variables of the soundscape evaluation factors. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175821198"

A new virtual-reality simulator might be helpful in deciding when a physician is competent to perform lumbar puncture. We aimed to investigate validity evidence for a simulator-based test in lumbar puncture and establish a pass/fail standard to allow a mastery learning training program. Methods: Validity evidence was investigated using Messick’s framework by including participants who were novices, intermediates, or experienced in lumbar puncture. Each participant performed two lumbar puncture procedures on the simulator, and fifty-nine predefined simulator metrics were automatically recorded. Cronbach’s alpha was used to explore internal consistency reliability. Intergroup comparisons were made using independent sample t-tests with Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons. The learning effect was explored using paired sample t-test analysis, and a pass/fail standard was established using the contrasting groups’ method. Results: 73 novices, 18 intermediates, and 19 physicians performed the test resulting in a total of 220 procedures. 25 metrics (42.4%) had good discriminatory ability, and the reliability of these metrics was good, Cronbach’s α = 0.81. The experienced physicians were significantly better than the novices (18.3 vs. 13.3, p < 0.001), and the pass/fail standard was established at 16 points. This standard resulted in 22 (30.1%) novices passing (i.e., false positives) and 5 (26.3%) physicians failing (i.e., false negatives). Conclusion: This study provides validity evidence for a simulator-based test of lumbar puncture competence. The test can help ensure basic competence at the end of a simulation-based training program for trainees, i.e., a mastery learning training program. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175640064"

Participants may thus be potentially unaware of their real, external world. The present study presented irrelevant auditory stimuli while participants were engaged in an easy or difficult visual working memory (WM) task within the VR environment. The difficult WM task should be immersive and require many cognitive resources, thus few will be available for the processing of task-irrelevant auditory stimuli. Sixteen young adults wore a 3D head-mounted VR device. In the easy WM task, the stimuli were nameable objects. In the difficult WM task, the stimuli were abstract objects that could not be easily named. A novel paradigm using event-related potentials (ERPs) was implemented to examine the feasibility of quantifying the extent of processing of task-irrelevant stimuli occurring outside of the VR environment. Auditory stimuli irrelevant to the WM task were presented concurrently at every 1.5 or 12 s in separate conditions. Performance on the WM task varied with task difficulty, with accuracy significantly lower during the difficult task. The auditory ERPs consisted of N1 and a later P2/P3a deflection which were larger when the auditory stimuli were presented slowly. ERPs were unaffected by task difficulty, but significant correlations were found. N1 and P2/P3a amplitudes were smallest when performance on the Easy WM task was highest. It is possible that even the easy WM task was so immersive and required many processing resources that few were available for the co-processing of the task-irrelevant auditory stimuli.

COVID-19 patients were hospital inpatients transferred to virtual wards and managed outside the hospital. Pharmacists had to provide distance medication management and support services. Virtual care patient support incorporated telehealth consultations by doctors, pharmacists and nurses. This study explored hospital clinicians’ experiences and perspectives on medication management and safety issues of the COVID-19 patients transferred from inpatient units (IPUs) to virtual models of care at the time of transfer. Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with purposively selected doctors, pharmacists and nurses involved in the management of COVID-19 patients in a virtual model of care (home or hotel). Clinicians were interviewed face-to-face or via MS Teams between March and May 2022. An interview schedule included 13 questions and prompts to explore perceptions of medication management and safety aspects. Results: Twenty clinicians were interviewed: six doctors, seven pharmacists, and seven nurses. The average interview time was 26 min (SD: 4.7; range 21–39). Four major medication management and safety themes emerged from the data: (1) complexities involved in efficient handover between IPU and virtual models of care; (2) lack of clarity on roles and responsibilities between hospital and primary care clinicians; (3) communication challenges when pharmacists work remotely; and (4) proactive management of specific medication safety risks. A common thread throughout the themes was concerns for potential impact on patient safety. Conclusion: Overall, clinicians were supportive of the virtual models although patient safety issues were raised that need to be addressed in the development of future services. The results from this study may inform improvements in medication safety implementation of future virtual models of care. © 2023, Dr. Zaheer-Ud-Din Babar and Auckland UniServices Ltd.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174968343"

Virtual reality (VR) systems have previously leveraged the benefits of immersion, interactivity, and entertainment to empower interior design. These systems, however, largely ignore the need to renovate houses in favor of a more immersive VR experience. To demonstrate the significance of scene reconstruction in redesign, we conducted experience prototyping with 8 professionals, outlining our design goals. Then, we propose RedesignUS, a VR system that enables users to rebuild and customize their own homes. By providing users with the flexibility to synthesize existing room layouts and fine-tune various levels of their homes leveraging inspiration from others’ combinations, RedesignUS offers an unparalleled degree of customization. A 24-user empirical study confirms that our system boosts editing efficiency and allows users to explore more options of home decoration, broadening their design horizons. Furthermore, scene restoration leads to enhanced realism and familiarity, thereby increasing their trust in our system.

These activities span a wide array of cognitive load types we face while executing motor functions. Here we use a virtual reality-based neurocognitive testing platform to assess cognitive-induced changes in motor behavior as reflected by modulations in head-hand coordination. Our paradigm is based on the Color Trails Test (CTT), which is designed to assess two types of cognitive functions: Trails A—sustained visual attention (SVA), and Trails B—divided attention (DA). The virtual reality CTT adaptation (VR-CTT) requires execution of large multi-directional hand movements and head rotations. We employed a cross-correlation analysis on hand and head kinematics data collected from 122 healthy participants (ages: 20–90 years; divided as follows: young, middle-aged, and older adults) who completed the VR-CTT. The level of spatial coherence of head-hand movements was found to be high (R ≥ 0.76) in both Trails A and B, in all age groups.

Quality in these interviews often falls short and current training programs are insufficient in enabling adherence to best practice. We present a system for simulating an interactive environment with alleged abuse victims using a child avatar. The purpose of the system is to improve the quality of investigative interviewing by providing a realistic and engaging training experience for police and CPS personnel. We conducted a user study to assess the efficacy of four interactive platforms: VR, 2D desktop, audio, and text chat. CPS workers and child welfare students rated the quality of experience (QoE), realism, responsiveness, immersion, and flow. We also evaluated perceived learning impact, engagement in learning, self-efficacy, and alignment with best practice guidelines. Our findings indicate VR as superior in four out of five quality aspects, with 66% participants favoring it for immersive, realistic training. Quality of questions posed is crucial to these interviews. Distinguishing between appropriate and inappropriate questions, we achieved 87% balanced accuracy in providing effective feedback using our question classification model. Furthermore, CPS professionals demonstrated superior interview quality compared to non-professionals, independent of the platform. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177588045"

Current treatment approaches yield unsatisfactory long-term effects with relapse rates up to 85%. Craving for alcohol is a major predictor for relapse and can be intentionally induced via cue exposure in real life as well as in Virtual Reality (VR). The induction and habituation of craving via conditioned cues as well as extinction learning is used in Cue Exposure Therapy (CET), a long-known but rarely used strategy in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) of AUD. VR scenarios with alcohol related cues offer several advantages over real life scenarios and are within the focus of current efforts to develop new treatment options. As a first step, we aim to analyze if the VR scenarios elicit a transient change in craving levels and if this is measurable via subjective and psychophysiological parameters. Methods: A single-arm clinical study will be conducted including n = 60 patients with AUD. Data on severity of AUD and craving, comorbidities, demographics, side effects and the feeling of presence in VR will be assessed. Patients will use a head-mounted display (HMD) to immerse themselves into three different scenarios (neutral vs. two target situations: a living room and a bar) while heart rate, heart rate variability, pupillometry and electrodermal activity will be measured continuously. Subjective craving levels will be assessed before, during and after the VR session. Discussion: Results of this study will yield insight into the induction of alcohol craving in VR cue exposure paradigms and its measurement via subjective and psychophysiological parameters. This might be an important step in the development of innovative therapeutic approaches in the treatment of patients with AUD.

Among them, Digital Twins (DT) allow the modelization of cyber–physical systems in the virtual world and Virtual Reality (VR) allows an immersive perspective of the behavior of industrial equipment in a digitized environment. The combination of DT and VR can generate a digital platform for operators’ training where the industrial operator can perceive a more realistic environment for digital learning. In this paper, we introduce the convergence of DT and VR to enhance the digital learning process of driving an industrial mobile robot. To validate this proposal, an experimental methodology looking for measuring the transfer of skills from digital training into the real world has been set. This experiment consists of handling a mobile robot in a predefined course looking for committing the lowest number of failures in the minimum possible time. The experiment has been carried out by defining three different training methods: training with real equipment as the control group and two different experimental groups following digital training (VR and computer application-supported techniques). The abilities of their subjects have been measured in the initial and final stages of the experiment showing an improvement of 47% through real training, 38% through VR and 28% through the computer application. Results demonstrate the utility of using DT to attain significant digital learning and validate the initial hypothesis demonstrating the enhancement of digital learning through VR-supported training. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170036750"

Within the classroom context, characteristics of teachers' body movements may be related to the noticing of relevant classroom events, in particular, visual attention to student disruptions. In the current study, we investigated this relationship in an immersive virtual reality (IVR) classroom that offered a standardized environment for tracking teachers' body and eye movements. Based on time series data collected during a short teaching task with 21 preservice teachers, we conducted K-means clustering with body movement features. We identified three distinctive patterns, which we labeled as immobile, anchored, and dynamic (body) movement patterns. Teachers with dynamic movement patterns venture away from the teacher's desk to far corners of the room; they don't dwell in one location for long but rather move continuously to various parts of the classroom, creating a dispersed movement. Dynamic movement patterns were associated with the best visual attention performance, defined as the number, speed, and duration of fixations on a classroom disruption. Our findings demonstrate the existence of unique and differentiable movement patterns among preservice teachers that have implications for teacher noticing, teacher–student interaction, and instructional quality. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169820757"

In this article, we describe an experiment (N=105) where participants used a climate change game in PC or immersive VR or were assigned to a text-based control. Our findings suggest that all three conditions increased climate change attitudes and environmental self-efficacy, but no significant differences were found between them. Although VR players tended to enjoy their experience significantly more than other participants, we did not find significant differences in self-reported immersion. Furthermore, neither enjoyment nor immersion correlated with attitude or self-efficacy shifts. Our exploration of participant behavior yielded similar results for all three conditions, both in commitment to action and self-reported completion ten days after the intervention.

This study examined impairments in self-assessments of cognitive performance, assessed with traditional neuropsychological assessments and novel virtual reality tests among older persons with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: One hundred twenty-two participants (82 persons with HIV; 79 MCI+) completed a traditional neuropsychological battery, DETECT virtual reality cognitive battery, and self-reported their general cognitive complaints, depressive symptoms, and perceptions of DETECT performance. Relationships between DETECT performance and self-assessments of performance were examined as were the correlations between general cognitive complaints and performance. These relations were evaluated across HIV and MCI status, considering the associations of depressive symptoms, performance, and self-assessment. Results: We found no effect of HIV status on objective performance or self-assessment of DETECT performance. However, MCI+ participants performed worse on DETECT and traditional cognitive tests, while also showing a directional bias towards overestimation of their performance. MCI- participants showed a bias toward underestimation. Cognitive complaints were reduced compared to objective performance in MCI+ participants. Correlations between self-reported depressive symptoms and cognitive performance or self-assessment of performance were nonsignificant. Conclusions: MCI+ participants underperformed on neuropsychological testing, while overestimating performance. Interestingly, MCI- participants underestimated performance to approximately the same extent as MCI+ participants overestimated. Practical implications include providing support for persons with MCI regarding awareness of limitations and consideration that self-assessments of cognitive performance may be overestimated. Similarly, supporting older persons without MCI to realistically appraise their abilities may have clinical importance. © 2023 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169905526"

In this regard, an outstanding paradigm shift is driven by the advancement of Virtual Reality, which can take advantage of Serious Games, for helping individuals develop responsive behaviours in case of both slow and sudden disasters and, thus, boosting effective human-urban-building interaction within a wider process of safety and sustainability. To this end, the paper proposes a VR-SG training prototype for multi-hazard scenarios in urban open spaces. The prototype integrates results from phenomenological and behavioural analyses and is applied to representative typologies of the built environment. The prototype is demonstrated for heat wave protection and earthquake response through the design and implementation of its functional features – virtual environment, interaction mode, learning outcomes and storyline – and its informative contents, including simulation-based data on surface temperatures, extent of falling debris and crowd motion. The final goal is to validate a reliable and flexible tool in view of wide replication in urban contexts for both instructing on critical situations and communicating mitigation strategies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169808003"

Whilst there are guidelines as to the ratio of lifeguards to patrons to ensure adequate supervision, there has been no empirical evidence to support these ratios. This research aims to ascertain the ideal ratio of lifeguards to persons in the water to detect a drowning victim within an appropriate timeframe to prevent death or neurological damage, using immersive virtual reality eye-tracking technology. Fifty qualified lifeguards in Victoria, Australia, viewed nine 120 s video clips filmed at a public pool, using a 360-degree GoPro camera to create a 360 view of one or two pools. Six videos contained simulated drownings, and three had no drowning. Videos were randomized with different scenes and patron numbers (25–115). Lifeguards noted if they identified a potential drowning and the time of identification. Results demonstrate that when the number of patrons exceeded 75, the lifeguards did not identify a drowning victim 50% of the time. A higher number of patrons in the pool also influenced the time taken by lifeguards to identify a potential drowning victim (>10 s). This study shows that with higher numbers of patrons in a pool, the ability of lifeguards to detect a drowning victim within the recommended time to prevent long-term effects decreases. Current guidelines for the ratio of patrons per lifeguard should be reviewed considering these findings. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172366999"

Our results provide evidence that virtual environments are playing an important role in shaping the economic behavior of our participants. We show that virtually mediated interactions between two participants within a formal virtual office setting lead to less equal sharing compared to our control group. Equal sharing is more common in surreal virtual environments. Thereby, we find evidence for the workings of either anchoring or framing effects.

It is an essential clinical skill for medical and healthcare professionals and should be practiced repeatedly. One way to do so is by using virtual reality (VR). The aim was therefore to develop a VR application to be used by inexperienced health students and professionals for self-instructed practice of systematic clinical observation using the ABCDE approach. Methods: An iterative human-centred approach done in three overlapping phases; deciding on the ABCDE approach, specifying the requirements, and developing the application. Results: A total of 138 persons were involved. Eight clinical observations were included in the ABCDE approach. The requirements included making it possible for inexperienced users to do self-instructed practice, a high level of immersion, and a sense of presence including mirroring the physical activities needed to do the ABCDE approach, allowing for both single and multiplayer, and automatic feedback with encouragement to repeat the training. In addition to many refinements, the testing led to the development of some new solutions. Prominent among them was to get players to understand how to use the VR hand controllers and start to interact with the VR environment and more instructions like showing videos on how to do observations. The solutions in the developed version were categorised into 15 core features like onboarding, instructions, quiz, and feedback. Conclusion: A virtual reality application for self-instructed practice of systematic clinical observation using the ABCDE approach can be developed with sufficient testing by inexperienced health students and professionals. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169760368"

In shedding light on the wide-ranging implications of metaverses, it navigates societal, cultural, regulatory, and economic landscapes. It further elucidates the symbiosis between the Internet of Things (IoT) and metaverses, presenting empirical evidence derived from purpose-built IoT frameworks for metaverse applications. A series of experiments were conducted to affirm the hypothesis that the integration of IoT into metaverse utilities, including advanced concepts such as smart buildings, the intricate task of power grid management, and the precision-centric domain of agriculture, can drive significant progress. Quantitative findings provide compelling evidence of marked improvements in energy conservation, cost-efficiency, and operational effectiveness arising from the incorporation of IoT into metaverse use cases.

Recent advancements in haptic feedback technology have been incorporated into preclinical dental education to augment the conventional phantom head-based training. Objective: This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of haptic feedback device, Simodont, in improving the skill development and learning outcomes of dental students during their preclinical training. Materials and methods: Electronic databases Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed were searched for relevant studies since inception up until March, 2023. Only English language studies that assessed the effectiveness of haptic feedback devices in preclinical dental education were included. We excluded studies that did not use Simodont as the haptic feedback device or did not involve preclinical restorative work. Study quality was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool and ROBINS-I. The primary goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Simodont as a complementary training modality for dentistry students. Results: Results from 9 high-quality studies were analyzed and synthesized to evaluate the overall impact of haptic feedback devices on various aspects of preclinical training. The studies were conducted on 826 undergraduate dental students enrolled in various years of their training across dental colleges and universities in different parts of the world. A majority of studies showed some concerns regarding risk of bias. Haptic feedback devices added a new layer to Virtual Reality (VR) through the perception of touch and force feedback. It assisted junior dental students improve their psychomotor skills and movement skills. Instantaneous feedback on the students' performance helped enhance their self-assessment and correction, and also eliminated the subjectivity of evaluation. Data derived from virtual simulators helped stratify dental students and predict their clinical performance, providing an opportunity to tailor the learning process to meet individual diversity in students' expertise. Conclusion: Based on the limited evidence available, Simodont was effective in preclinical training of dental students, offering advantages such as unlimited reproducibility, objective evaluation of preparation by computer assessment, and cost reduction. And further studies are warranted to explore the incorporation of patient's oral environment simulation for better skill training. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173633293"

Recently, many research using VR-based mindfulness (VBM) has been carried out in various psychiatric disorders but not in psychosis. We investigated safety and effects of virtual reality-based mindfulness (VBM) in patients with psychosis as a pilot study. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to VBM or to VR control. For VBM, education and meditation videos were provided. For VR control, 3-dimensional natural scenes were shown. Both programs consisted of 8 weekly sessions, each lasting about 30 min. Pre- and post-assessments were performed using the experiences questionnaire (EQ), psychotic symptom rating scales-delusion (PSYRATS-D), PSYRATS-auditory hallucinations (AH), motivation and pleasure scale-self rating (MAP-SR) and etc. The safety questionnaire was also surveyed after 1st and 8th session. Physiological measures such as skin conductance level (SCL), heart rate (HR) and RR interval, were collected during the VR interventions. Limited individuals participated in the safety questionnaire and physiological measures. All the results were presented in mean and standard deviation. We did not observe significant results in group x time interaction and main effects of group and time in the decentering and clinical scales. However, within group comparison showed that patients randomized to VBM showed increased decentering (p = 0.029) and decreased amount (p = 0.032) and duration of preoccupation (p = 0.016) in the PSYRATS-D. For the feelings and motivations about close caring relationships of the MAP-SR, we observed a significant group x time interaction (p = 0.027).

While studies suggest that the sense of spatial presence in IVR enhances enjoyment and thus learning, it is unclear whether IVR also presents information in a way that is more conducive to learning than less immersive presentations. Because IVR presents spatial details more accurately than less immersive media, in addition to motivational effects, IVR presentations should promote the acquisition of spatial and (aurally presented) semantic knowledge. Research also suggests that the effects of IVR presentation on spatial presence, enjoyment, and learning may be offset by visuospatial imagery skills. We tested these assumptions by conducting a randomized laboratory experiment with two conditions in which a virtual learning environment was presented using either IVR technology or less immersive desktop VR. Results show that IVR did not provide superior support the acquisition of spatial and semantic knowledge, and this was not moderated by visuospatial imagery. However, spatial presence mediated the acquisition of semantic knowledge through enjoyment in both conditions, and this effect was moderated by learners' level of imagery: IVR's advantages over desktop VR in promoting spatial presence, enjoyment, and semantic knowledge diminished as learners' visuospatial imagery increased. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172401477"

Still, the precise relationship between bodily self-consciousness (BSC) and memory formation of specific events, especially in real-life contexts, remains a topic of ongoing research. The present study investigated the relationship between BSC and episodic memory (EM) using immersive virtual reality (VR) technology. Participants were immersed in an urban environment with naturalistic events, while their visuomotor feedback was manipulated in three within-subjects conditions: Synchronous, Asynchronous, and No-body. Our results show that asynchronous visuomotor feedback and not seeing one’s body, compared to synchronous feedback, decrease the sense of self-identification, self-location and agency, and sense of presence. Moreover, navigating in the Asynchronous condition had a detrimental impact on incidental event memory, perceptual details, contextual association, subjective sense of remembering, and memory consolidation. In contrast, participants in the No-Body condition were only impaired in egocentric spatial memory and the sense of remembering at ten-day delay. We discuss these findings in relation to the role of bodily self-representation in space during event memory encoding. This study sheds light on the complex interplay between BSC, sense of presence, and episodic memory processes, and strengthens the potential of embodiment and VR technology in studying and enhancing human cognition. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173391767"

Often, poor health literacy and limited resources can lead to interrupted care, which places them at risk for adverse health-related consequences. In 2019, the Wisconsin Adult Congenital Heart Disease transition program partnered with Stanford Virtual Heart (SVH), a virtual reality (VR) platform, to allow young adult patients to learn about their CHD in a clinic-based setting. We completed a single-center pilot study to evaluate these patients’ experience and perceptions to using VR during their transition education. At an initial transition visit, we used an immediate post-VR experience survey, scored using Likert scales of 1–5 (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Twenty-two patients (13 males) between the ages of 16 and 19 participated. Lesions included pulmonary stenosis, Tetralogy of Fallot, atrial and ventricular septal defect, coarctation, aortic stenosis, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and patent ductus arteriosus. Likert averages were 4.7 for finding VR helped with understanding their heart lesion, 4.6 for finding VR helped with understanding their heart surgery, 4.7 for enjoying the VR heart simulation, and 4.6 for finding that it was a good use of time. This study demonstrates that adolescents enjoyed using SVH and found it helpful. Clinical implementation shows promise as a plausible adjunct tool for transition education. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169901832"

In emergencies, acute stress activated by the threat of hazards influences human wayfinding efficiency and safety. However, the underlying cognitive basis of the influence of acute stress on the wayfinding process remains unclear. To narrow this knowledge gap, we focused on the core cognitive process, namely selective attention during emergency wayfinding, and conducted a virtual reality (VR)-based wayfinding experiment with a within-subject design. Three stress level settings were designed to induce participants’ stress. For each trial, participants were required to finish the wayfinding task within five minutes, during which a VR version of the Eriksen flanker task (EFT) was set to evaluate selective attention with the eye tracking function embedded in the VR helmet. The result demonstrated the positive effect of stress on the information process speed in selective attention measured by response time and the wayfinding performance measured by net distance. In addition, we found that the response time in selective attention plays a mediation role in the relationship between stress in the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and wayfinding performance. This study provides researchers with a new pathway to investigate the cognitive mechanism in emergency wayfinding with VR and eye tracking technologies. The findings are expected to advance the understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanism in emergency wayfinding, which has significant implications for developing evacuation simulation considering cognitive processes, as well as for evacuation planning of complex indoor environments and crowd evacuation management during indoor emergencies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172688336"

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of VR-facilitated exercise to modulate pain. Design: Within-subject cross-over clinical trial. Setting: The Stanford Chariot Program conducted this study at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford (LCPHS). Patients: Healthy participants meeting inclusion criteria were recruited by volunteer solicitation from LCPHS. Interventions: Participants were randomized by hand dominance and subjected to a standardized cold pressor test with no VR or exercise. After a 5-min wash-out period, participants repeated the test on their other hand while experiencing a VR-facilitated exercise condition. Pain sensitivity, pain tolerance, and sympathetic activation data were collected during both conditions. Measurements: Pain sensitivity was scored 0–10 and collected every 30 s. Pain tolerance was recorded as the duration a participant could endure the painful stimuli. Sympathetic activation was measured by skin conductance response density (SCRD) and recorded in 30 s epochs by a biosensor. In all analyses, data were nested by participant. Main results: Forty-one participants completed both interventions. Pain sensitivity was reduced in the VR-facilitated exercise condition (p < 0.0001). There was no difference in pain tolerance between conditions. While both conditions resulted in an increase in sympathetic activity, SCRD was higher at all time points in the VR-facilitated exercise condition. Conclusions: The reduction in pain sensitivity indicates VR-facilitated exercise results in improved pain perception. VR-facilitated exercise may be especially useful for patients with chronic pain or other conditions requiring physical therapy, where pain may be exacerbated by exercise. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170565563"

Thus, this study contributes to the development of sustainable and healthy environments by examining the effect of the soundscape and landscape experience on psycho-physiological restoration from the audio-visual interaction perspective. It examined various urban and natural environments to propose a restoration model for environmental design application. Sixty participants evaluated three each of urban, waterfront, and green environments using virtual reality technology. The audio-visual characteristics of environments were quantified, and environmental perception was assessed per 14 audio-visual element identifications, six perceived affective qualities, and six overall environmental qualities. The restoration responses were classified as psychological and physiological. Accordingly, 10 restoration models that can interpret design factors of the urban environment with a maximum correlation of 0.80 and an explanatory power of 22 % emerged from urban audio-visual design elements and psycho-physiological responses. Consequently, to improve restoration response, visually attractive and spatial-natural landscapes and acoustically supportive and tranquil soundscapes should be created. Moreover, urban designers can use the models to clearly identify physical characteristics that should be prioritized when promoting the health improvement of urbanites. Furthermore, the study findings can serve as basic data for the development of healthy environments. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173043608"

The game focuses on simulating the palmar grasping exercise commonly used in clinical settings. The system’s design follows a user-centered approach, involving close collaboration with functional rehabilitation specialists and stroke patients. It uses the Leap motion controller to enable patient interaction in the virtual environment, which was created using the Unity 3D game engine. The system relies on hand gestures involving opening and closing movements to interact with virtual objects. It incorporates parameters to objectively measure participants’ performance throughout the game session. These metrics are used to personalize the game’s difficulty to each patient’s motor skills. To do this, we implemented an approach that dynamically adjusts the difficulty of the exergame according to the patient’s performance during the game session. To achieve this, we used an unsupervised machine learning technique known as clustering, in particular using the K-means algorithm. By applying this technique, we were able to classify patients’ performance into distinct groups, enabling us to assess their skill level and adapt the difficulty of the game accordingly. To evaluate the system’s effectiveness and reliability, we conducted a subjective evaluation involving 11 stroke patients. The standardized System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire was used to assess the system’s ease of use, while the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) was used to evaluate the participants’ subjective experience with the system. Evaluations showed that our proposed system is usable and acceptable on a C-level scale, with a good adjective score, and the patients perceived a high intrinsic motivation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172141230"

It is crucial in vection research to present a stronger sense of movement. Bone-conducted vibration (BCV) is a small and generally acceptable method for enhancing the sense of movement in VR. However, its effects on vection have not been extensively studied. Here, we conducted two experiments to investigate the effect of BCV on the vection, which generates an upward sensation under the hypothesis that BCV stimulation to the mastoid processes causes noise in the vestibular system and enhances visually-induced self-motion perception. The experiments focused on the effects of BCV stimuli of different frequencies on the vection experience. The results suggested that 500 Hz BCV was more effective as noise to the vestibular system than other frequency BCVs and improved self-motion sensation.

For each module, the corresponding measures were transformed into scores using a series of functions such that ceiling and flooring effects would be minimized. The results showed an association between scores and age, an overlap in scores from impaired high-performance individuals and able-bodied low performance individuals, and a correlation of PAT scores with other clinical tests.

The use of relaxing music, audiovisuals, and virtual reality (VR) technologies has been employed to reduce dental anxiety. This network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of relaxing music, audiovisuals, and VR in reducing dental anxiety associated with tooth extraction. Methods: Four electronic databases were searched up to March 8, 2023, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating different multimedia interventions, including the application of using relaxing music, audiovisuals, and VR technologies for dental anxiety. Studies utilizing various anxiety scales for tooth extraction were considered eligible. The pooled standard mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of anxiety scale scores were analyzed using Bayesian NMA. Results: A total of 11 RCTs were included in this NMA. The Bayesian NMA results demonstrated that relaxing music (SMD = -0.64, 95% CI: -1.04, -0.25) and VR (SMD = -0.54, 95% CI: -1.08, -0.02) were associated with a reduction in dental anxiety, while audiovisuals (SMD = -0.34, 95% CI: -0.97, 0.33) required further consideration. Ranking probabilities indicated that relaxing music might be the most acceptable method for individuals with dental anxiety. The frequentist NMA yielded consistent rankings in a sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: Relaxing music shows the greatest potential for reducing dental anxiety related to tooth extraction when compared to other multimedia interventions. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171899411"

Specifically, the study focuses on the applications of Digital Twins in the heritage construction sector, an area characterized by significant potentials and challenges in various research fields (e.g., energy, digital technology, citizen engagement, cultural aspects, management, etc.). Bibliographic and scientometric analyses enable the systematic categorization of the literature, analyzing a total of 133 scientific publication realized in the years 2001–2023. The bibliometric analysis outlines time evolution, geographical distribution, type, and disciplinary fields of the publications. Meanwhile, the scientometric research identifies co-occurrence networks of authors, keyworks, and research topics. Thank to these techniques, the following research topics on Digital Twins in the Built Heritage have been identified and clustered: (i) Digital Twins and 3D scanner techniques; (ii) Digital Twins and virtual reality; (iii) Digital Twins and Heritage Building Information Model (HBIM); and (iv) Digital Twins and Internet of Things (IoT). Each technique is critically discussed, highlighting applications, methods, limitations, and gaps in the literature. This analysis also paves the way for future research directions and potential solutions to enhance the automation in the heritage sector. Additionally, a glossary of essential disciplinary terms is provided to guide the understanding of individual definitions as they apply to heritage constructions. The primary challenges relate to accuracy, security, interoperability, and synchronization of data and technologies from various sources, requiring appropriate verification and validation methodologies, as well as tailored standards, protocols, interfaces, and regulations. Moreover, ethical considerations should underlie the utilization of digitally driven predictions that incorporate human-computer techniques, and human–robot interactions. This extends to the formulation of specific policies, and legislation. Only through this approach, the immense potential of digital technologies can emerge to create cross-cutting professions, interactive engagement techniques, and compatible preservation and management activities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170231050"

This study investigated the impact of scenario and interaction fidelity on IVR-based forklift safety training, focusing on presence and usability. Scenario fidelity varied the Level of Development (LOD) in IVR model (high LOD vs. low LOD), while interaction fidelity varied the control interface (steering wheel and pedals vs. keyboard). A 2-by-2 experiment with 120 participants examined high/low scenario and interaction fidelity. Results showed scenario fidelity enhanced presence and usability significantly, while interaction fidelity had no effect. The realism of training scenarios is more influential for presence and immersion than control interface realism.

The accuracy of the best-estimate ASTEC simulation was evaluated with the Fast Fourier Transform Based Method (FFTBM) against the experimental data. Then, the uncertainty of the code results was quantified by using the probabilistic propagation of input uncertainties method, through the coupling of ASTEC with RAVEN (Risk Analysis and Virtual Environment).

In contrast to previous qualitative investigations of various immersive contexts, our study is unique in both the use of validated scales and the structured comparison of four experimental conditions: 1.live concert (LC), 2.the same concert through a traditional non-immersive music video (MV, analogous to fruition on YouTube), and finally in a virtual reality environment (VR), provided by two different devices, 3. a google cardboard (CVR) and 4. an HTC vive (HVR), allowing respectively for a basic and easily accessible experience, or for a less affordable but more immersive one. Through these manipulations we presumably affected not just the subjective aesthetic experience, but also the perceived presence of the Other/s. Consistently we measured both through the administration of the Aesthetic Emotions Scale (Aesthemos) and the Networked Minds Measure of Social Presence (NMMSP). The NMMSP showed no notable differences between conditions, which instead emerged from the analyses on the Aesthemos. The most liked experience was the Live one. Results also showed that LC experience had a stronger emotional impact only when compared to MV and CVR, but not to HTC since this last manipulation was the one eliciting the greatest interest. Theoretical implications are critically discussed, suggesting novel applications of the proposed approach. © 2023","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172030486"

Being a rare and complex procedure performed in extreme situations, repetitive training of REBOA teams is critical. Evidence-based guidelines on how to train REBOA are missing, although simulation-based training has been shown to be effective but can be costly and complex. We aimed to determine the feasibility and acceptance of REBOA training using a fully immersive virtual reality (VR) REBOA simulation, as well as assess the confidence in conducting the REBOA procedure before and after the training. Methods: Prospective feasibility pilot study of prehospital emergency physicians and paramedics in Bern, Switzerland, from November 2020 until March 2021. Baseline characteristics of trainees, prior training and experience in REBOA and with VR, variables of media use (usability: system usability scale, immersion/presence: Slater-Usoh-Steed, workload: NASA-TLX, user satisfaction: USEQ) as well as confidence prior and after VR training were accessed. Results: REBOA training in VR was found to be feasible without relevant VR-specific side-effects. Usability (SUS median 77.5, IQR 71.3–85) and sense of presence and immersion (Slater-Usoh-Steed median 4.8, IQR 3.8–5.5) were good, the workload without under-nor overstraining (NASA-TLX median 39, IQR 32.8–50.2) and user satisfaction high (USEQ median 26, IQR 23–29). Confidence of trainees in conducting REBOA increased significantly after training (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Procedural training of the REBOA procedure in immersive virtual reality is possible with a good acceptance and high usability. REBOA VR training can be an important part of a training curriculum, with the virtual reality-specific advantages of a time- and instructor-independent learning. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173754090"

NINPT leverages peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal mechanisms to restore normal pain processing and limit central sensitization. However, heterogeneity in treatment protocols and individual responses warrants optimization through precision medicine approaches. Conclusion: Future adoption of NINPT requires addressing limitations in standardization and accessibility as well as synergistic combination with emerging therapies.

For each study, we report which categories of surfaces were used (indoor, outdoor, treadmill, virtual reality and qualitative), the nature of each surface (stairs, slopes, slippery, compliant, rough or default) and how information about each surface was measured. We found that minimal information was provided for many surfaces, making it impossible to meaningfully compare results for different types of surfaces across studies.

Anticholinergic pharmaceuticals (e.g., Meclizine) are often taken prior to landing; however, they have operationally adverse side effects (e.g., drowsiness). There is a need to develop non-pharmaceutical countermeasures to EMS. We assessed the efficacy of a technological countermeasure providing external visual cues following splashdown, where otherwise only nauseogenic internal cabin visual references are available. Our countermeasure provided motion-congruent visual cues of an Earth-fixed scene in virtual reality, which was compared to a control condition with a head-fixed fixation point in virtual reality in a between-subject design with 15 subjects in each group. We tested the countermeasure’s effectiveness at mitigating motion sickness symptoms at the end of a ground-based reentry analog: approximately 1 h of 2Gx centrifugation followed by up to 1 h of wave-like motion. Secondarily, we explored differences in vestibular-mediated balance performance between the two conditions. While Motion Sickness Questionnaire outcomes did not differ detectably between groups, we found significantly better survival rates (with dropout dictated by reporting moderate nausea consecutively over 2 min) in the visual countermeasure group than the control group (79% survival vs. 33%, t(14) = 2.50, p = 0.027). Following the reentry analogs, subjects demonstrated significantly higher sway prior to recovery (p = 0.0004), which did not differ between control and countermeasure groups. These results imply that providing motion-congruent visual cues may be an effective mean for curbing the development of moderate nausea and increasing comfort following future space missions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173779017"

Consequently, its potential for higher education, including nursing, is being explored as a dynamic alternative to traditional education. Objectives: This study explores the applicability of metaverse in nurse education. It was conducted to implement a mock court on the metaverse platform and explore the learning experiences of nursing students through mock trials. Design: Qualitative study. Settings: A virtual mock court in VRChat (a virtual reality space). Participants: Fourteen participants were divided into three groups. Methods: An orientation was conducted to explain the virtual space before the mock trial. On the day of the mock trial, a health survey of study participants was conducted in advance. After the mock trial, questionnaires and reflective diaries were written. Results: The experiences of nursing students were organized into eleven sub-themes and three themes: “core features of the metaverse platform,” “participation in a mock trial in the VRChat virtual space,” and “metaverse-based learning using a mock trial.” Conclusions: Nursing students participated and immersed themselves in learning while accepting the characteristics of the metaverse platform, which differs from face-to-face classes or existing educational methods. The metaverse enables reflective learning based on experiential learning and strengthens awareness of diverse viewpoints. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171259381"

This paper provides the first comprehensive review on the use of 360-degree video for virtual place-based research, highlighting its use in experimental, experiential, and environmental observation studies. Five key research domains for 360-degree video are described: tourism and cultural heritage; built environment and land use; natural environment; health and wellbeing; and transportation and safety. 360-degree video offers considerable advantages compared to unidirectional video, computer-generated virtual reality, and map-based geographic representation. Benefits include ease of use, low-cost, interactivity, sense of immersive realism, remote accessibility, and the ability to capture and analyze places in a fully panoramic field of view. Limitations include additional costs associated with virtual reality viewing technologies, simulation sickness and discomfort, and viewer distraction due to the technology's novelty and immersive affordances. This paper also outlines a future research agenda, including the possibility of moving beyond the ‘testing and trialling’ of 360-degree video since it provides novel research opportunities distinct from either ‘real’ experience or conventional forms of visual and spatial representation. Overall, this paper provides detailed evidence for researchers interested in using 360-degree video for virtual research on built, social, and natural environments and human-environment interactions. © 2023 The Authors","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173148251"

Pain is subjective, and perception will vary among individuals depending on their health status, pain tolerance, and psychological state. Labor pain can drastically affect the birth process and delivery outcomes if not managed well, ranging from poor maternal satisfaction and impaired maternal-newborn bonding to prolonged labor and fetal distress. Since pharmacological pain relief methods harm the fetus, non-pharmacological pain relief methods are gaining popularity among laboring women and healthcare professionals. Objectives: The study aimed to evaluate the effect of audio-visual therapy on labor pain and maternal anxiety. Methods: A randomized, controlled, open-label, single-center trial was conducted among 76 primigravida women with no obstetrical complications during the active phase of labor (4–8 cm cervical dilatation). The participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group receiving 50 min of virtual reality intervention or a control group receiving standard care using a computer-generated random sequence. The data related to pain and anxiety were collected using the personal information form, anxiety assessment scale for pregnant women in labor, present behavioral intensity scale, numerical pain rating scale, and post-delivery birth satisfaction checklist. Results: Groups were homogenous in terms of demographic and obstetric variables. The virtual reality intervention reduced the experimental group's reported pain intensity and anxiety score. However, no statistically significant difference was noted in maternal vital signs and labor and neonatal outcomes between the groups. Conclusion: The virtual reality intervention reduced labor pain intensity and anxiety among laboring women compared to standard care. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171733631"

This continuous trend of internet traffic has led to the deterioration of the quality of service (QoS) with reduced throughput and increased latency. This also is due to the proliferation of new broadband applications which require low latency and high throughput such as virtual reality and real-time gaming. Therefore, considering the aforementioned challenge in QoS of wireless networks, a link adaptation method is suggested in this study, in order to enhance the performance of the QoS in IEEE 802.11ac amendment wireless local-area network (WLAN). The proposed technique adaptively changes the transmission data rate by increasing or decreasing the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) level according to the traffic conditions. With the use of an OMNeT++ computer-aided design (CAD)-based simulation model, the effectiveness of the suggested approach is examined. Simulated findings were compared with the link adaptation approach of the default condition. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the proposed technique significantly increases throughput (36.48%) and decreases latency in comparison to the default situation. These findings demonstrate the technique's potential to improve WLAN QoS efficiency, notably in regard to throughput and latency. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

This touch resulted in a tingling sensation corresponding to the location touched on the virtual body. We called it “phantom touch illusion” (PTI). Interestingly, the illusion was also reported when subjects touched invisible (inferred) parts of their limb. We reason that this PTI results from tactile gating process during self-touch if there is no tactile input to supress. The reported PTI when touching invisible body parts indicates that tactile gating is not exclusively based on vision, but rather on multi-sensory, top-down input involving body schema.

VR applications are a great example of how immersive environments like Metaverse can take our perception to a new level. Locomotion is the most critical component in VR applications. Locomotion means movement from one place to another in a virtual reality environment. However, VR locomotion can have physical and psychological effects on users. These include potential adverse effects such as cybersickness (CS), eyestrain, disorientation, and psychological problems such as addiction or detachment from reality. Predicting potential problems is essential to understanding and mitigating them. A VREEG dataset was obtained to predict VR locomotion effects with thirty-two participants who completed ten locomotion techniques. This dataset used objective and subjective measures for VR locomotion tasks to assess physiological, usability, and cybersickness/predictability. A predictive model has used EEG features extracted from time, frequency, and time–frequency domains. This model achieved an accuracy of 99% from the dataset for nausea, oculomotor, and disorientation levels. It has also attracted attention due to its teleportation techniques (such as shift and blink locomotion), fast transitions, and low CS.

Of the 1199 retrieved articles, 101 were included in the final analysis. The described models can be subdivided into 5 major categories: (1) enhanced cadaveric heads; (2) animal models; (3) training artificial solutions, with increasing complexity (from “box-trainers” to multi-material, ct-based models); (4) training simulators, based on virtual or augmented reality; (5) Pre-operative planning models and simulators. Each available training model has specific advantages and limitations. Costs are high for cadaver-based solutions and vary significantly for the other solutions. Cheaper solutions seem useful only for the first stages of training. Most models do not provide a simulation of the sellar tumor, and a realistic simulation of the suprasellar arachnoid. Most artificial models do not provide a realistic and cost-efficient simulation of the most delicate and relatively common phase of surgery, i.e., tumor removal with arachnoid preservation; current research should optimize this to train future neurosurgical generations efficiently and safely. © 2023, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171635351"

To address, this study conducts an integrated critical review to identify the application of CDVT and assess their contribution to the prevention, mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery stages of flood risk management. The results show that virtual reality, augmented reality, and digital twin technologies are the primary CDVT used in urban flood visualisation, with virtual reality being the most frequently used. The focus of urban flood visualisation studies has been primarily on preparation and mitigation stages. However, there is a need to investigate the application of these technologies in the entire urban water cycle. Furthermore, there is potential for greater adoption of digital twin, especially in simulating urban flood inundation and flood evacuation routes. Integrating real-time data, data-driven modeling, and CDVT can significantly improve real-time flood forecasting.

With virtual reality (VR), optic flow can be controlled to mediate alterations in human walking. The aim of this study was to investigate (1) the effects of fully immersive VR and optic flow speed manipulation on gait biomechanics, simulator sickness, and enjoyment in people post-stroke and healthy people, and (2) the effects of the level of immersion on optic flow speed and sense of presence. Methods: Sixteen people post-stroke and 16 healthy controls performed two VR-enhanced treadmill walking sessions: the semi-immersive GRAIL session and fully immersive head-mounted display (HMD) session. Both consisted of five walking trials. After two habituation trials (without and with VR), participants walked three more trials under the following conditions: matched, slow, and fast optic flow. Primary outcome measures were spatiotemporal parameters and lower limb kinematics. Secondary outcomes (simulator sickness, enjoyment, and sense of presence) were assessed with the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, Visual Analogue Scales, and Igroup Presence Questionnaire. Results: When walking with the immersive HMD, the stroke group walked with a significantly slower cadence (-3.69strides/min, p = 0.006), longer stride time (+ 0.10 s, p = 0.017) and stance time for the unaffected leg (+ 1.47%, p = 0.001) and reduced swing time for the unaffected leg (− 1.47%, p = 0.001). Both groups responded to the optic flow speed manipulation such that people accelerated with a slow optic flow and decelerated with a fast optic flow. Compared to the semi-immersive GRAIL session, manipulating the optic flow speed with the fully immersive HMD had a greater effect on gait biomechanics whilst also eliciting a higher sense of presence. Conclusion: Adding fully immersive VR while walking on a self-paced treadmill led to a more cautious gait pattern in people post-stroke. However, walking with the HMD was well tolerated and enjoyable. People post-stroke altered their gait parameters when optic flow speed was manipulated and showed greater alterations with the fully-immersive HMD. Further work is needed to determine the most effective type of optic flow speed manipulation as well as which other principles need to be implemented to positively influence the gait pattern of people post-stroke.

However, traditional contact sensing makes the spread of bacteria and viruses, and single sensing also limits the development. Hence, as an innovative product, a non-contact/contact dual-mode sensor has to come into being, which consists of stretchable bacterial cellulose (BC)-BC/graphene (Gr) helical fibers. The helical fiber with a sheath-core structure, and the degradable BC as the sheath and BC/Gr as the core, which exhibit a tensile strength of 113 MPa and elongation at a break of 477%. Under non-contact mode, the capacitance change (ΔC/C0) arrives to –0.6 (–60%) when the approaching distance is 0.5 cm, and the remote communication through capacitance changes when it is sewn on the lab-gown as a wearable wireless non-contact phone. Under contact mode, action guidance and detection are achieved successfully through interaction with virtual space. All in all, this work will lead to a new era of non-contact human-machine interfaces (HMI) and dual-mode sensors, providing a solid research foundation and leading thinking for wearable electronic products that require non-contact or multi-function Internet of Things (IoT) and virtual reality (VR) field. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171325801"

This study aimed to investigate the impact of a simulation-based learning activity on student learning and subjective task values in a medical morphology-related course of Human Parasitology. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted with 113 Chinese undergraduate medical students who participated in a Human Parasitology course during April to May 2022. Students were divided into two groups: Simulation Group (n = 55), where students used the simulation, and Lecture Group (n = 58), where students attended an online lecture. Students’ learning was measured prior to the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and three weeks later to assess knowledge retention. The subjective task values questionnaire was administered before and after the interventions. Data were analyzed using one-way ANCOVA and MANOVA. Results: Students in the Simulation Group exhibited significantly higher knowledge gain compared to the Lecture Group [F (1,110) = 23.69, p < 0.01]. Additionally, the Simulation Group retained knowledge significantly better than the Lecture Group [F (1,101) = 10.05, p < 0.005]. Furthermore, students in the Simulation Group experienced a significant increase in subjective task values after the intervention [F (3, 52) = 3.57, p < 0.05, ηp2 = 0.17], while students in the Lecture Group reported a significant decrease in subjective task values [F (3, 55) = 2.96, p < 0.05, ηp2 = 0.14]. Conclusions: Simulation-based learning not only leads to superior learning but also enhances students’ subjective task values. These findings offer valuable insights into designing effective simulation-based learning experiences in medical education and have significant practical implications for educators and medical professionals. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169651853"

The scratch response might result in a vicious cycle of alternating itching and scratching. To develop psychological interventions for people suffering from chronic itching and to break the vicious itch-scratching-itch cycle, it is important to elucidate which environmental factors trigger itch sensations. Virtual reality (VR) techniques provide a useful tool to examine specific content characteristics in a three-dimensional (3D VR) environment and their influences on itch sensations and scratching behaviour. This article describes two experiments in which we focused on the effects of environmental information on itching and scratching behaviour. Additionally, in the second experiment, we examined the influence of having a chronic skin condition on sensitivity to itch induction. We found evidence for the importance of the content of audio–visual materials for the effectiveness in inducing feelings of itch in the observers. In both experiments, we observed significantly higher levels of perceived itch in the itch-inducing conditions than in the control condition. Moreover, the results showed that elevated levels of perceived itch were associated with an increase in scratching behaviours, which was especially salient in the contagious itch condition, in which perceived itch was accompanied by a significant increase in the number of scratches. Experiment 2 additionally showed increased perceived itch levels in participants who reported having a chronic skin condition, reflecting higher sensitivity to itch-inducing audio–visual stimuli in this group than in participants without a chronic skin condition. Based on the results we concluded that directing attention towards itch- or scratch aspects of related information in the environment and to the consequences for one’s own skin are effective tools to induce itch sensations and scratching behaviour. This knowledge provides tools for developing novel strategies in advising and treating people suffering from chronic itching and breaking the vicious itch-scratching-itch cycle. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173323885"

Although the number of studies about the different use of VR and AR increases year by year, a systematic overview of the applications of these innovative technologies in intensive care medicine is lacking. The aim of this systematic review was to provide a detailed summary of how VR and AR are currently being used in various areas of intensive care medicine. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed until 1st March 2023 to identify the currently existing evidence for different applications of VR and AR for both health care providers in the intensive care unit and children or adults, who were in an intensive care unit because of a critical illness. Results: After screening the literature, a total of 59 studies were included. Of note, a substantial number of publications consists of case reports, study plans or are lacking a control group. Furthermore, study designs are seldom comparable. However, there have been a variety of use cases for VR and AR that researchers have explored. They can help intensive care unit (ICU) personnel train, plan, and perform difficult procedures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, vascular punctures, endotracheal intubation or percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. Patients might benefit from VR during invasive interventions and ICU stay by alleviating stress or pain. Furthermore, it enables contact with relatives and can also assist patients in their rehabilitation programs. Conclusion: Both, VR and AR, offer multiple possibilities to improve current care, both from the perspective of the healthcare professional and the patient. It can be assumed that VR and AR will develop further and their application in health care will increase.

Generative learning activities may mitigate some of the limitations of immersive learning by helping learners focus on making sense of the key material. The main aim of this study was to examine whether learners benefit from being prompted to engage in individual or collaborative generative learning activities while immersed in a VR lesson compared to viewing the same lesson with no breaks. High school students (N = 164) viewed a biology lesson adapted for immersive VR about how our cells are structured and function. For the experimental conditions, the lesson was split up into four parts, with a pause after each part where learners summarized the main points and created a virtual representation of a cell; this was performed individually or collaboratively within the VR environment. Based on generative learning theory, we predicted that students engaging in individual and collaborative generative learning activities would display significantly higher posttest scores than the control group. Based on theories of computer-supported collaborative learning, we examined whether the collaborative generative activity group would achieve higher posttest scores than the individual generative activity group. The results showed that adding collaborative generative activities to a VR lesson was more effective at improving learning than adding individual generative activities. These results are consistent with collaborative cognitive load theory and demonstrate the value of adding collaborative generative learning activities to immersive VR lessons. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173559106"

Methods: This study protocol is for a randomized controlled trial consisting of 2 treatment sessions (3 days/week for 4 weeks in each session, with a 1-week interval between sessions). We will recruit children aged 3–10 years with unilateral spastic CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System level I or II). Participants will be randomly divided into 3 groups: the VR + rTMS group (immersive VR intervention, rTMS and routine rehabilitation therapy), rTMS group (rTMS and routine rehabilitation therapy), and control group (sham rTMS and routine rehabilitation therapy). VR therapy will involve a daily 40-minute movement training session in a fully immersive environment. rTMS will be applied at 1 Hz over the primary motor cortex for 20 min on the contralateral side. The stimulation intensity will be set at 90% of the resting motor threshold, with 1200 pulses applied. A daily 60-minute routine rehabilitation therapy session including motor training and training in activities of daily living will be administered to all participants. The primary outcome will be pain intensity, assessed by the Revised Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability Scale (R-FLACC). The secondary outcomes will include motor development, evaluated by the 66-item version of the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66) and Fine Motor Function Measure (FMFM); balance capacity, measured by the interactive balance system; activities of daily living; and quality of life, measured by the Barthel index and the Chinese version of the Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life scale for Children (C-CP QOL-Child). Safety will be monitored, and adverse events will be recorded during and after treatment. Discussion: Combined application of VR therapy and rTMS may reveal additive effects on pain management and motor development in children with spastic CP, but further high-quality research is needed. The results of this trial may indicate whether VR therapy combined with rTMS achieves a better analgesic effect and improves the motor development of children with spastic CP.

In Tanzania, the number of neurosurgeons and neurosurgical services offered have expanded in the past 40 years. Training opportunities within the country, however, are not sufficient to meet the needs of residents, specialists, and nurses in neurosurgery, forcing many to train outside the country incurring associated costs and burdens. We report on the Dar es Salaam Global Neurosurgery Course, which aims to provide local training to neurosurgical health care providers in Tanzania and surrounding countries. Methods: We report the experience of the Global Neurosurgery Course held in March 2023 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We describe the funding, planning, organization, and teaching methods along with participant and faculty feedback. Results: The course trained 121 participants with 63 faculty—42 from Tanzania and 21 international faculty. Training methods included lectures, hands-on surgical teaching, webinars, case discussions, surgical simulation, virtual reality, and bedside teaching. Although there were challenges with equipment and Internet connectivity, participant feedback was positive, with overall improvement in knowledge reported in all topics taught during the course. Conclusions: International collaboration can be successful in delivering topic-specific training that aims to address the everyday needs of surgeons in their local setting. Suggestions for future courses include increasing training on allied topics to neurosurgery and neurosurgical subspecialty topics, reflecting the growth in neurosurgical capacity and services offered in Tanzania. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172663089"

However, decision-making for VPPs in such complex environments is challenging due to multiple uncertainties and complexities. This paper proposes an approach that optimizes decision-making for VPPs using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in urban environments with diverse supply-demand profiles and DERs. The approach addresses challenges related to integrating renewable energy sources and achieving energy efficiency. An RL-based VPP system is trained and tested under different scenarios, and a case study is conducted in a real-world urban environment. The proposed approach achieves multi-objective optimization by performing actions such as load-shifting, demand offsetting, and providing ancillary services in response to demand, renewable generators, and market signals. The study validates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach under complex environmental conditions. Results demonstrate that the approach provides optimized decisions in various urban environments with different available resources and supply-demand profiles. This paper contributes to understanding the use of RL in optimizing VPP decision-making and provides valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners in sustainable and resilient cities. © 2023","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170405706"

To support the swift implementation of technologies, we identified the current trends through a bibliometric review, and we conducted a survey on Italian pediatricians to gauge educational needs and willingness to integrate technologies into clinical practice. Methods: A working group of pediatricians representing various backgrounds designed and coordinated the study. To identify relevant topics for educational strategy development, we focused on virtual reality, telehealth, natural language processing, smartphone applications, robotics, genomics, and artificial intelligence. A bibliometric analysis limited to 2018–2023 was performed to identify trends and emerging applications within each topic. Based on the results, a questionnaire was developed and made available online to all Italian pediatricians. The results were analyzed through descriptive analysis and a multivariable logistic regression to explore associations between technology adoption and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: A total of 3,253 publications were found, with Telehealth and Telemedicine having the highest number of publications and Natural Language Processing the lowest. The number of respondents to the online questionnaire was 1,540, predominantly medical doctors with over 20 years of experience working as family pediatricians. Telehealth had the highest level of knowledge (95.2%), followed by smartphone applications (89.1%) and genomics (63.2%). The greatest potential for increased use through education programs was projected for natural language processing (+ 43.1%), artificial intelligence (+ 39.6%), and virtual and mixed reality (+ 38.1%). Female respondents and older individuals were less likely to use emerging technologies. Hospital pediatricians and residents were more likely to use AI. Conclusions: We developed a replicable strategy to identify emerging themes in medical technologies relevant to pediatrics and assess the educational needs of pediatricians. A significant gap still exists between current and potential usage of emerging technologies among Italian pediatricians although they showed a positive attitude towards implementing these technologies following specific education programs. The study highlights the need for comprehensive education programs on emerging technologies in pediatrics and recommends addressing gender and age disparities in technology adoption. © 2023, Società Italiana di Pediatria.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169685629"

Building on social comparison theory, this pattern is assumed to result from students comparing themselves to their classmates; however, based on existing research designs, it remains unclear how exactly students make use of social comparison information in the classroom. To determine the extent to which students (N = 353 sixth graders) actively attend and respond to social comparison information in the form of peers’ achievement-related behaviour, we used eye-tracking data from an immersive virtual reality (IVR) classroom. IVR classrooms offer unprecedented opportunities for psychological classroom research as they allow to integrate authentic classroom scenarios with maximum experimental control. In the present study, we experimentally varied virtual classmates’ achievement-related behaviour (i.e., their hand-raising in response to the teacher’s questions) during instruction, and students’ eye and gaze data showed that they actively processed this social comparison information. Students who attended more to social comparison information (as indicated by more frequent and longer gaze durations at peer learners) had less favourable self-evaluations. We discuss implications for the future use of IVR environments to study behaviours in the classroom and beyond. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169998953"

Mental health problems in pregnant women already since early weeks of gestation may have important consequences to the fetus. The necessity for more effective health care pathways, including some early interventions that reduce the overall burden of the childbearing situation appears a key factor for a successful birth and care of the baby. The few studies focalized in interventions, are focused on delivery and postpartum, without taking into account the whole maternity process. Current literature recommends the use of interventions based on new technologies for the treatment of mood disorders, already during the prenatal period. There have been scarce well-designed intervention studies that test technological low-intensity interventions by midwives to address pregnant women’s mental health, diminishing anxiety and depression during pregnancy. Methods/design: Adult pregnant women (weeks 12–14 of gestation) will be recruited and screened from different primary care centers in Catalonia, Spain. Women who pass the initial mental screening will be randomly allocated to the relaxation virtual reality intervention or control group. The intervention aims to improve mental state of pregnant women during pregnancy, work through breathing, mindfulness and muscle relaxation techniques. Women in the control group will receive standard care offered by the public funded maternity services in Catalonia. The primary outcome measures will include the Edinburg Postnatal Depression (EPDS), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), and the Cambridge Worry Scale (CWS) instruments. Secondary outcome measures will include the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) and the Whooley and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2) questions. Routinary pregnancy monitoring measures will be also evaluated. Discussion: This study aims to test the efficacy of a low-intensity, midwife-led e-health intervention based on new technologies to work on women’s anxiety and depression during pregnancy. We hypothesize that low-intensity mental health intervention during pregnancy, using an e-health (virtual reality) as a support tool, will be effective in reducing of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and improving satisfaction with pregnancy follow-up.

In this study, social interaction is considered a potentially promising approach to addressing cybersickness. A total of 30 participants were recruited to join both social and solitary experimental tasks in VR experiments. The subjective and objective experiences in relation to cybersickness in VR were collected. The results indicated that social interaction could mitigate the sense of cybersickness. Significant differences were observed in verbally rated cybersickness, physiological measurements, and machine learning classifications. Random forest models were constructed to classify the severity of VR cybersickness and identify the feature importance in detecting cybersickness.

In addition, edge intelligence is becoming necessary for low-latency real-time applications to process the data at the source device. Therefore, processing massive amounts of data impact memory footprint, prediction time, and energy consumption, essential performance metrics in machine learning based internet of things (IoT) edge clusters. However, deploying deeper, dense, and hefty weighted CNN models on resource-constraint embedded systems and limited edge computing resources, such as memory, and battery constraints, poses significant challenges in developing the compact optimized model. Reducing the energy consumption in edge IoT networks is possible by reducing the computation and data transmission between IoT devices and gateway devices. Hence there is a high demand for making energy-efficient deep learning models for deploying on edge devices. Furthermore, recent studies show that smaller compressed models achieve significant performance compared to larger deep-learning models. This review article focuses on state-of-the-art techniques of edge intelligence, and we propose a new research framework for designing a compact optimized deep learning (DL) model deployment on edge devices. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

However, the aggregate evidence collected to date has not been thoroughly evaluated for strength, quality, and reproducibility. An umbrella review from published meta-analyses of RCTs was conducted to evaluate the strength and quality of existing evidence regarding the efficacy of VR training in improving the motor performance, ADL and QoL outcomes of patients with PD. Methods: PubMed, PsychInfo, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched to identify relevant meta-analysis of RCTs examining the effects of VR training on motor performance and quality of life outcomes in PD patients. We recalculated the effect sizes (Hedges’g) for VR training using DerSimonian and Laird (DL) random effects models. We further assessed between-study heterogeneity, prediction interval (PI), publication bias, small-size studies, and whether the results of the observed positive studies were better than would be expected by chance. Based on these calculations, the quality of evidence for each outcome was assessed by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) criteria. Results: Four meta-analysis with eight outcomes included in the umbrella review was recalculated effect size. Pooled results found VR training can large improve the basic balance ability, moderate improve the overall balance capacity and moderate improve the stride length in PD patients. For ADL and QoL, the effect sizes were pooled that suggested VR training can moderate improve ADL and QoL for PD patients. However, no statistically clear evidence was found in walking speed, motor function and gait function during VR training. The analyzed meta-analyses showed low-to-moderate methodological quality (AMSTAR2) as well as presented evidence of moderate-to-very low quality (GRADE). Tow adverse reactions were reported in the included meta-analyses. Conclusions: In this umbrella review, a beneficial correlation between VR and balance ability, stride length, ADL and QoL in PD patients was discovered, especially for the very positive effect of VR on balance because of two of the eight outcomes related to balance ability showed large effect size. The observations were accompanied by moderate- to very low-quality rating evidence, supporting VR training as a practical approach to rehabilitation. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173566026"

However, there is no consensus on what type of VR content is the best for pain alleviation and by what means VR modulates pain perception. We used three experiments to explore the analgesic effect of VR scenes in healthy adult volunteers. Methods: We first compared the effect of immersive VR on pain perception with active (i.e. non-immersive, two-dimensional video) and passive (i.e. no VR or audiovisual input) controls at both subjective perceptual (Experiment 1) and electrophysiological (electroencephalography) levels (Experiment 2), and then explored possible analgesic mechanisms responsible for VR scenes conveying different strategies (e.g. exploration or mindfulness; Experiment 3). Results: The multisensory experience of the VR environment lowered pain intensity and unpleasantness induced by contact heat stimuli when compared with two control conditions (P=0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). The reduced pain intensity rating correlated with decreased P2 amplitude (r=0.433, P<0.001) and increased pre-stimulus spontaneous gamma oscillations (r=−0.339, P=0.004) by 32-channel electroencephalography. A VR exploration scene induced a strong sense of immersion that was associated with increased pre-stimulus gamma oscillations (r=0.529, P<0.001), whereas a VR mindfulness meditation scene had a minor effect on immersive feelings but induced strong pre-stimulus alpha oscillations (r=−0.550, P<0.001), which led to a comparable analgesic effect. Conclusions: Distinct neural mechanisms are responsible for VR-induced analgesia, deepening our understanding of the analgesic benefits of VR and its neural electrophysiological correlates. These findings support further development of digital healthcare. © 2023 British Journal of Anaesthesia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173064288"

In the context of world peace, the world economy is developing rapidly and the process of urbanization is accelerating. The construction of a city not only reflects the economic strength of the city, but also is closely related to the life of the citizens. Therefore, this paper aimed to explore a new way of urban cultural creative design. This paper focused on the application of human–computer interaction virtual reality (VR) technology in urban cultural creative design. For this reason, this paper designed an interactive and immersive urban design simulation platform based on VR technology. In order to choose the viewing angle freely and control the design module freely, this paper proposed improved gesture recognition algorithm and anti-collision algorithm. The algorithm designed in this paper can enable designers to have better presentation effects when working on the platform, making architectural design more intuitive. Experiments show that the average accuracy rate of the gesture recognition algorithm designed in this paper reaches 97.3%, which is 4.1% higher than that of the traditional algorithm; and when the anti-collision algorithm in this paper is set to the optimal parameters, the accuracy rate is as high as 95%. These results fully demonstrate that the human–computer interaction VR technology design platform proposed in this paper has good design performance and can be applied to urban cultural creative design. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169531043"

However, the existing embolic materials have poor embolization effectiveness, posing a great challenge to highly efficient embolization. In this study, we construct Janus particle-engineered structural lipiodol droplets by programming the self-assembly of Janus particles at the lipiodol-water interface. As a result, we achieve highly efficient renal embolization in rabbits. The obtained structural lipiodol droplets exhibit excellent mechanical stability and viscoelasticity, enabling them to closely pack together to efficiently embolize the feeding artery. They also feature good viscoelastic deformation capacities and can travel distally to embolize finer vasculatures down to 40 μm. After 14 days post-embolization, the Janus particle-engineered structural lipiodol droplets achieve efficient embolization without evidence of recanalization or non-target embolization, exhibiting embolization effectiveness superior to the clinical lipiodol-based emulsion. Our strategy provides an alternative approach to large-scale fabricate embolic materials for highly efficient embolization and exhibits good potential for clinical applications. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170375771"

To address this challenge, a digital twin (DT) framework is established to fill the data for train fault diagnosis. A train bearing dynamics model is optimized using virtual-reality mapping in the DT framework with measured health data as a baseline to generate data closer to reality. Finally, the fault diagnosis uses a hybrid dataset that mixes measured and simulated data as a source domain for transfer learning.

Most self-learning methods necessitate such interactions frequently to find the optimal solutions due to the exploratory and iterative behaviours of the players throughout the learning process. Nevertheless, in industrial environments, these interactions are generally expensive and time-consuming, as well as have potential risks. One possible approach to address this challenge is by employing an accurate digital representation of the system. However, developing an accurate digital representation is often a complex task. Therefore, the proposed MB-SbPG approach offers a solution that effectively learns the dynamics of the relevant systems and optimizes them within virtual environments. To achieve the stated objectives, the MB-SbPG approach consists of two primary steps. Firstly, deep learning models are designed to accurately predict system dynamics. Secondly, the SbPG players are trained within virtual environments, which enables the distributed self-optimization features of the system. Within the scope of this research, we examine two separate strategies for MB-SbPGs, namely (a) MB-SbPGs with single-step predictors and (b) MB-SbPGs with multi-step predictors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MB-SbPGs have the potential to enhance memory-based learning on SbPG. We also validate the suitability of reusing the trained networks on MB-SbPGs for transfer learning in adaptable systems. To assess its effectiveness, we implement and validate MB-SbPG in a real industrial control scenario using a laboratory-scale testbed, which ends up with encouraging results. © 2023 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173241575"

Using Virtual Reality and head-mounted displays this therapy can be performed in virtual scenarios. However, for its efficient use in clinical settings, some hardware limitations need to be solved. A new system to perform mirror therapy in virtual scenarios for post-stroke patients is proposed. The system requires the patient a standalone virtual reality headset with hand-tracking features and for the rehabilitator an external computer or tablet device. The system provides functionalities for the rehabilitator to prepare and follow-up rehabilitation sessions and a virtual scenario for the patient to perform rehabilitation. The system has been tested on a real scenario with the support of three experienced rehabilitators and considering ten post-stroke patients in individual sessions focused on upper limb motor rehabilitation. The development team observed all the sessions and took note of detected errors regarding technological aspects. Solutions to solve detected problems will be proposed and evaluated in terms of feasibility, performance cost, additional system cost, number of solved issues, new limitations, or advantages for the patient. Three types of errors were detected and solved. The first error is related to the position of the hands relative to the head-mounted display. To solve it the exercise area can be limited to avoid objectives that require turning the head too far. The second error is related to the interaction between the hands and the virtual objects. It can be solved making the main hand non-interactive. The last type of error is due to patient limitations and can be mitigated by having a virtual hand play out an example motion to bring the patient’s attention back to the exercise. Other solutions have been evaluated positively and can be used in addition or instead of the selected ones. For mirror therapy based on virtual reality to be efficient in post-stroke rehabilitation the current head-mounted display-based solutions need to be complemented with specific strategies that avoid or mitigate the limitations of the technology and the patient. Solutions that help with the most common issues have been proposed. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170158100"

However, while IVR is primarily investigated and utilized in technical domains, its implementation and the resulting effects in commercial education remain largely unexplored. Moreover, the experience of motion sickness is a widely reported phenomenon while using IVR, which can interfere with cognitive processes and should therefore be considered more closely in terms of learning and instruction. This explorative study focuses on domain-specific knowledge acquisition in vocational apprenticeship for retailers and the accompanying side effects on students’ wellbeing in an IVR-based learning environment. For this purpose, an IVR-based scenario in a virtual supermarket was developed and tested with trainees in the field of retail at a German commercial vocational school. Using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design, we compared the effects of IVR-based and conventional instruction on domain-specific knowledge acquisition in a sample of first-year trainees (N = 79).

We wanted to investigate whether a single session of an embodiment-based immersive VR training program influences pain-free range of motion in patients with shoulder pain. Methods: We designed a rehabilitation program based on developing ownership over a virtual body and then “exercising” the upper limb in immersive VR, while the real arm remains static. We then carried out a single-arm pre-post experiment in which 21 patients with movement-related musculoskeletal shoulder pain were exposed to the 15-min VR program and measured their active pain-free range of motion immediately before and afterwards. Results: We found that shoulder abduction and hand-behind-back movements, but not shoulder flexion, were significantly and clinically improved post-intervention and that the level of improvement correlated with the level of embodiment. Following this one session, at 1-week follow-up the improvements were not maintained. Conclusions: Virtual embodiment may be a useful therapeutic tool to help improve range of motion in patients with movement-related shoulder pain in the short term, which in turn could expedite rehabilitation and recovery in these conditions. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172070948"

This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses IVR's impact on adult and pediatric cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Methods: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We focused on anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain, and anxiety in adults and pain and anxiety in pediatric patients. Results: Fifteen trials were included, enrolling 607 adult and 257 pediatric cancer patients. IVR significantly reduced anxiety (SMD = −1.89, 95% CI = −2.93 to −0.85), depression (SMD = −1.85, 95% CI = −3.14 to −0.55), fatigue (SMD = −3.40, 95% CI = −5.54 to −1.26), and systolic blood pressure (MD = −3.54, 95% CI = −6.67 to −0.40) in adults.

Despite its potential, current DHM simulations grapple with challenges like high computational costs, significant latency, low precision, and limited realism. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a novel DHM simulation approach that synergizes the Kinect motion capture system, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and advanced machine learning techniques. Distinctively, our method captures real-time human motion data through IoT devices and the Kinect system, followed by data preprocessing and feature extraction. In contrast to traditional methodologies, we harness deep learning to establish time-series models, integrating convolutional neural networks and dilated convolutional kernels to amplify processing capabilities and cater to multi-scale data. Furthermore, we employ virtual reality technology to craft a digital human structural model, streamlining motion simulation and optimization. Experimental evaluations underscore that our approach consistently outperforms conventional methods across all metrics, demonstrating robust real-time simulation capabilities.

However, this integration has increased interactions between drones and workers, posing significant safety challenges for workers. This paper assessed the physical risks of drones on construction sites using VR-based 4D simulations. Roofs, ladders, and scaffolds were identified as the top high-risk environments where workers were at an increased risk of accidents when working around drones. A system-level virtual simulation environment was developed to run 2700 simulations per scenario with varying parameters, mimicking and visualizing potential interactions between workers, structures, equipment, and drones flying at different distances of workers: Near-Drone (<4 ft) and Distant-Drone (>4 ft). The results suggest that the Distant-Drone had a higher frequency of collision incidents with equipment and the ground, while the Near-Drone had a higher frequency of collision incidents with buildings and workers. This differential impact of flight parameters and interaction distance on drone collisions implied the need for targeted safety strategies for different working contexts. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171533260"

The Lyapunov analysis method shows that the stability of the closed-loop system and the convergence of the estimation weights for the actor–critic network are guaranteed.

Streptococcus agalactiae is a highly virulent bacteria that cause mastitis. The administration of antibiotics for the treatment of this infection is not advised due to concerns about the emergence of antibiotic resistance and potential adverse effects on human health. Thus, there is a critical need to identify new therapeutic approaches to combat mastitis. One promising target for the development of antibacterial therapies is the transmembrane histidine kinase of bacteria, which plays a key role in signal transduction pathways, secretion systems, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. Results: In this study, we aimed to identify novel natural compounds that can inhibit transmembrane histidine kinase. To achieve this goal, we conducted a virtual screening of 224,205 natural compounds, selecting the top ten based on their lowest binding energy and favorable protein–ligand interactions. Furthermore, molecular docking of eight selected antibiotics and five histidine kinase inhibitors with transmembrane histidine kinase was performed to evaluate the binding energy with respect to top-screened natural compounds. We also analyzed the ADMET properties of these compounds to assess their drug-likeness. The top two compounds (ZINC000085569031 and ZINC000257435291) and top-screened antibiotics (Tetracycline) that demonstrated a strong binding affinity were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns), free energy landscape, and binding free energy calculations using the MM-PBSA method. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the selected natural compounds have the potential to serve as effective inhibitors of transmembrane histidine kinase and can be utilized for the development of novel antibacterial veterinary medicine for mastitis after further validation through clinical studies. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172143444"

Currently, very few or no studies are based on the systematic analysis of the HSPs in Glioblastoma (GBMs) and ependymomas. We performed an integrated omics analysis to predict the mutual regulatory differential HSP signatures that were associated with both glioblastoma and ependymomas. Further, we explored the various common dysregulated biological processes operating in both the tumors, and were analyzed using functional enrichment, gene ontology along with the pathway analysis of the predicted HSPs. We established an interactome network of protein-protein interaction (PPIN) to identify the hub HSPs that were commonly associated with GBMs and ependymoma. To understand the mutual molecular mechanism of the HSPs in both malignancies, transcription factors, and miRNAs overlapping with both diseases were explored. Moreover, a transcription factor-miRNAs-HSPs coregulatory network was constructed along with the prediction of potential candidate drugs that were based on perturbation-induced gene expression analysis. Based on the RNA-sequencing data, HSP90AB1 was identified as the most promising target among other predicted HSPs. Finally, the ranking of the drugs was arranged based on various drug scores. In conclusion, this study gave a spotlight on the mutual targetable HSPs, biological pathways, and regulatory signatures associated with GBMs and ependymoma with an improved understanding of crosstalk involved. Additionally, the role of therapeutics was also explored against HSP90AB1.

Trial under-enrollment leads to underpowered studies. Behavioral economics offers strategies that may enhance trial recruitment. This study assessed the impact of behavioral economic strategies versus a standard biological approach to recruit children into a randomized clinical trial assessing a biofeedback-based virtual reality intervention for postoperative pain management. We hypothesized the behavioral economics-informed approach would increase enrollment into the future trial, intention to adhere to therapy, acceptability of the intervention, and perceived efficacy while decreasing perception of treatment burden and risk. Methods: This single-center, prospective, randomized trial recruited patients 12-18 years old undergoing surgery requiring postoperative admission and narcotic administration. Patient-parent dyads were randomized to watch a behavioral economics-informed (n = 64) or standard biological (n = 66) recruitment video about a study designed to assess impact of a virtual reality pain management intervention. Results: There was no difference in rates of intention to enroll in the study between groups (behavioral economics: 75%, control: 79%, p = 0.744) or in median response scores to questions regarding intention to adhere to therapy (4.0 [3.0, 4.0] vs. 4.0 [3.0, 4.0], p=0.084), acceptability of therapy (4.0 [3.0, 4.0] vs. 4.0 [3.0, 4.0], p = 0.376), perceptions of treatment burden (3.0 [3.0, 4.0] vs. 4.0 [3.0, 4.0], p=0.251), and efficacy (3.0 [3.0, 4.0] vs. 3.0 [3.0, 4.0], p = 0.914). Patients in the behavioral economics group were less likely to perceive risk associated with virtual reality versus the control group (behavioral economics: 2.0 [1.0, 2.0], control: 2.0 [2.0, 3.0], p = 0.023). Discussion: A behavioral economics-informed video did not increase patients’ intentions to enroll into a clinical trial assessing the impact of virtual reality intervention for postoperative pain management. Conclusion: Either approach would be sufficient for patient recruitment for this type of clinical trial since the overall intention to enroll rate was 77%. © 2023 The Authors.

In order to increase performance, concurrent programs are always preferred. But the concurrency produces obstacles to different phases of software development, including testing and debugging. Finding faults in a concurrent program is always a challenging task due to the presence of many threads overlapping each other, problems in sharing memories, etc. In this paper, we have proposed a Back propagation neural network (BPNN) to generate ranks for each class of a given program. These ranks indicate the probability of a fault being present in each class. The model is trained using test case coverage data, and it is tested using virtual test cases. In all three case studies, the fault localization technique assigned the highest rank to the classes where the actual faults were implanted. By using BPNN and training the model with test case coverage data, the technique shows promising results in identifying the classes where faults are likely to occur. This can greatly aid in the testing and debugging processes of concurrent programs, improving their overall performance. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171463980"

This research explores the design and evaluation of a multi-finger continuous zoom-based technique for selecting targets that are small, distant and located in dense virtual environments. We design, evaluate and present two techniques, AMAZE and AMAZE-X via two studies. In our first study, we compared AMAZE to existing methods of Expand and Pinch-to-Select and found that it outperformed them in accurately selecting objects. AMAZE also ranked as the most natural and enjoyable technique. However, AMAZE had the highest task completion time, prompting us to refine it into AMAZE-X. We made two crucial adjustments: increasing the CD ratio and adding user-to-object distance visualization. We assessed AMAZE-X's performance against the techniques from the first study. AMAZE-X demonstrated superior performance in terms of task completion time without errors, as well as being easy to use, learn, and the most favored technique among participants.

To determine a neural basis for this ability, we examined the mouse superior colliculus (SC), which contains multiple egocentric maps of sensorimotor space. By placing mice in a whisker-guided virtual reality, we discovered a rapidly adapting tactile response that transiently emerged during externally generated gains in whisker contact. Responses to self-generated touch that matched self-generated history were significantly attenuated, revealing that transient response magnitude is controlled by sensorimotor predictions. The magnitude of the transient response gradually decreased with repetitions in external motion, revealing a slow habituation based on external history. The direction of external motion was accurately encoded in the firing rates of transiently responsive neurons. These data reveal that whisker-specific adaptation and sensorimotor predictions in SC neurons enhance the localization of unexpected, externally generated changes in tactile space. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173561983"

Recent studies indicate that one of the topics that is still little explored in this area is software testing, as VR applications can be built for practically any type of purpose, making it difficult to generalize knowledge to be applied. In this paper, we present an approach that combines metamorphic testing, agent-based testing and machine learning to test VR applications, focusing on finding collision and camera-related faults. Our approach proposes the use of metamorphic relations to detect faults in collision and camera components in VR applications, as well as the use of intelligent agents for the automatic generation of test data. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted an experimental study on four VR applications, and the results showed an (Formula presented.) of the solution ranging from 93% to 69%, depending on the complexity of the application tested. We also discussed the feasibility of extending the approach to identify other types of faults in VR applications.

Miller et al.'s (2020) quantitative study recommended in-depth, qualitative study of the stressors faced by foster parents during COVID-19. Objective: Accordingly, this qualitative study sought to fill a gap in the literature regarding foster parents' lived experiences of foster parenting stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants and setting: Virtual, semi-structured interviews were conducted with n = 20 foster parents from across one Southern U.S. state between April and July 2021. Methods: Verbatim transcripts were analyzed utilizing Braun and Clarke's (2006) thematic analysis. Results: Five themes emerged in the analysis: (1) Varied Descriptions of Fostering in a Pandemic; (2) Nowhere to Go; (3) COVID-Consciousness; (4) The Virtual Reality; and (5) Stress Relief. Eight total additional subthemes were recorded. All themes and subthemes were described with representative direct quotations from the data. Conclusions: Findings from this study demonstrated foster parents experienced both shared and unique parenting challenges during COVID-19. Three areas for further consideration and development in practice included improving online service delivery, strengthening guidance for online parent-child visitation, and enhancing support for foster parents of children with special needs. Developing social support and self-care practices should continue to be ongoing priorities for foster parents and foster parent-serving agencies. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171389733"

Currently, haptic feedback is mostly used in low-force medical procedures in dentistry, laparoscopy, arthroscopy and alike. However, joint replacement procedures at hip, knee or shoulder, require the simulation of high-forces in order to enable motor-skill training. In this work a prototype of a haptic device capable of delivering double the force (35 N to 70 N) of state-of-the-art devices is used to examine the four most common haptic rendering methods (penalty-, impulse-, constraint-, rigid body-based haptic rendering) in three bimanual tasks (contact, rotation, uniaxial transition with increasing forces from 30 to 60 N) regarding their capabilities to provide a realistic haptic feedback. In order to provide baseline data, a worst-case scenario of a steel/steel interaction was chosen. The participants needed to compare a real steel/steel interaction with a simulated one. In order to substantiate our results, we replicated the study using the same study protocol and experimental setup at another laboratory. The results of the original study and the replication study deliver almost identical results. We found that certain investigated haptic rendering method are likely able to deliver a realistic sensation for bone-cartilage/steel contact but not for steel/steel contact. Whilst no clear best haptic rendering method emerged, penalty-based haptic rendering performed worst. For simulating high force bimanual tasks, we recommend a mixed implementation approach of using impulse-based haptic rendering for simulating contacts and combine it with constraint or rigid body-based haptic rendering for rotational and translational movements. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164383967"

However, sometimes education does not sufficiently prepare nurses for the real world. Virtual reality (VR) is an innovative method to complement existing learning strategies, yet few studies investigate its effectiveness. This study compared educational outcomes achieved by three groups learning with either of two different VR simulation variants, with varying technological features, or a video training on the endotracheal suctioning skill. Methods: The investigated outcomes were knowledge and skill acquisition, learner satisfaction, and technology acceptance. 131 undergraduate nursing students were randomised into three groups, based on the interventions they received. Knowledge was assessed through a pre-post-test design, skill through a post-intervention objective structured clinical examination on a manikin, learning satisfaction and technology acceptance through standardised questionnaires, and qualitative feedback through focus groups. Results: All interventions led to a significant knowledge acquisition, with no significant difference between the groups. The video intervention group performed significantly better than the VR groups in skill demonstration. One of the two VR intervention groups had a significantly higher learner satisfaction than the video group. Technology acceptance was high for both VR groups, with the simpler VR simulation resulting in higher technology acceptance than the one with more experimental features. Students described the VR experience as realistic, interactive, and immersive, and saw the opportunity to practise skills in a safe environment, learn from mistakes, and increase knowledge and confidence. Conclusions: For the development of VR trainings, we recommend keeping them simple and targeting a specific educational outcome since trying to optimise for multiple outcomes is resource intensive and hard to achieve. Psychomotor skills were easier for participants to learn by watching a video on the procedure rather than practically learning it with the VR hardware, which is a more abstract representation of reality. We therefore recommend using VR as a complementing resource to skills labs, rather than replacing existing learning strategies. Perhaps VR is not ideal for practising practical psychomotor skills at the moment, but it can increase knowledge, satisfaction, motivation, confidence and prepare for further practical training.

We tested whether women with fibromyalgia (FM) are receptive to bodily illusions of owning a visible and progressively invisible body in immersive virtual reality (VR), and what modulates this experience. Twenty patients participated in two experimental sessions; each session included two conditions in a counterbalanced order. We found that patients with FM could indeed experience virtual embodiment. Sentiment analysis revealed significantly more positive reactions to the progressively invisible body, yet twice as many patients declared they preferred the illusion of a visible virtual body. A linear mixed model revealed that the strength of embodiment was positively associated with body perception disturbances and negatively associated with FM symptoms intensity. No effect of pain during the VR experience nor interoception awareness on embodiment was found. The results indicated that patients with FM are receptive to virtual bodily illusions and that the impact of the embodiment depends on affective reactions, the level of cognitive body distortions, and the intensity of symptoms. Importantly, there is a large variation among patients which should be considered in future VR-based interventions. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163849516"

Individuals with PSA often express fear of being evaluated by others and avoid eye contact. Despite this behavioral characteristic, the potential of gaze avoidance reduction as a therapeutic intervention to alleviate PSA-related anxiety remains unexplored. Methods: We designed a standalone virtual reality (VR) gaze exposure treatment focused on enhancing eye contact in public speaking contexts and evaluated its effectiveness in reducing state anxiety during public speaking. In a single-blind, randomized controlled trial, 89 participants with subclinical PSA were assigned to either a gaze exposure treatment or a control group. Assessments occurred at baseline, following a one-hour intervention, and after nine additional 20-minute home interventions. The primary outcome was state anxiety, assessed using the Subjective Units of Distress Scale during a real-life public speaking test. Results: Repeated, but not acute VR gaze exposure reduced state anxiety during public speaking compared to the control group (treatment: baseline 48.95 [SD 19.52], post-intervention 2: 26.60 [SD 19.23]; control: baseline 48.92 [SD 18.43], post-intervention 2: 56.34 [SD 28.15]; adjusted mean group difference: -29.82, 95% CI: -41.77 to -17.87; Cohen's d = -1.07, p < 0.0001). Limitations: Our study design does not allow conclusions regarding the effective component (i.e., gaze exposure vs. social context) of the intervention. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that repeated VR gaze exposure treatment in public speaking contexts can effectively reduce state anxiety during public speaking among individuals with subclinical PSA. These promising results call for further investigations in clinical populations. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165697606"

In the IaaS cloud, the virtual machine (VM) is the execution unit that processes the user workloads. Virtualization enables the execution of multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical machine (PM). Virtual machine placement (VMP) strategically assigns VMs to suitable physical devices within a data center. From the cloud provider's perspective, the virtual machine must be placed optimally to reduce resource wastage to aid economic revenue and develop green data centres. Cloud providers need an efficient methodology to minimize resource wastage, power consumption, and network transmission delay.

Millions who suffer from addiction, psychosis, depression and suicidality are either untreated or inadequately treated and organized psychiatry is unable to reach them. Possibly as reflection of under-treatment of psychiatric disorders, the rates of suicide have risen: from 1999 through 2014, the age-adjusted suicide rate in the US increased 24%, from 10.5 to 13.0 per 100,000.

The use of digital footprints has been advocated for large-scale data collection that can facilitate psychiatric research in naturalistic settings. We highlight recent papers in Discover Mental Health addressing digital approaches to mental health and we also advance here the concept that digital footprints are ready for clinical use.

However, given that these learning environments differ from conventional classroom learning activities, current assessment practices may be insufficient for assessing learning in immersive environments. This paper develops the concept of a game-based assessment framework (GBAF) for educators interested in the assessment of learning in digital games, VR or AR. Importantly, this paper also presents the application of the framework to the design and implementation of assessments for a VR game during the game design phase. Grounded in the principles of Constructive Alignment and the Evidence-Centred Design (ECD) framework, this assessment framework describes the steps to consider for assessments and outlines the components that must be aligned for the design of assessments. To illustrate the application of the GBAF to the design of assessments for immersive learning environments, a stepwise design of assessments for a VR game is presented. The results of the outcome of the assessment of laboratory health and safety competencies of six engineering students is also presented. The GBAF offers simple and useful guidelines for the design of assessments around game tasks. It could serve as a structured basis for educators and researchers to design assessments to measure lower and higher-order cognitive learning in complex immersive environments. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162854604"

Standard treatment is vestibular rehabilitation therapy, and virtual reality (VR) could improve outcomes. The objective of this study was to identify the commercially available VR video game that is most congruent to vestibular rehabilitation therapy. Methods: A term search “virtual reality racing” was performed on the App Store in March 2022. Results were screened for free point-of-view racing games compatible with Android and iOS devices. An investigator was filmed playing each game and videos were distributed to 237 physiotherapists. Physiotherapists completed a survey of 5-point Likert scale questions that assessed the video games vestibular rehabilitation potential. Survey responses were analyzed using Friedman Two-Way ANOVA (alpha = 0.05) and paired samples sign test with Bonferroni correction. Results: The search yielded 58 games, 4 were included. Forty physiotherapists participated. VR Tunnel Race (VRTR) and VR Real World Bike Racing (VRWBR) had the greatest vestibular rehabilitation potential (median global scores = 18.00). VRTR replicated habituation exercises significantly (p < 0.001) better than Derby VR, and VRWBR replicated physiotherapist-prescribed exercises significantly (p < 0.001) better than VR X-Racer. There were no discernable significant differences between VRWBR and VRTR. Conclusions: VRTR and VRWBR are the most congruent VR games to standard vestibular rehabilitation. VRWBR is preferable to VRTR with respect to ease of use and the ability to alter the amount of optokinetic stimulation. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of these videos games and to determine if they could be used as solitary treatments. Trial registration : Not applicable.

To date, research has mainly focused on the full control of electromagnetic characteristics, including polarization, phase, amplitude, and even frequencies. Consequently, versatile possibilities of electromagnetic wave control have been achieved, yielding practical optical components such as metalenses, beam-steerers, metaholograms, and sensors. Current research is now focused on integrating the aforementioned metasurfaces with other standard optical components (e.g., light-emitting diodes, charged-coupled devices, micro-electro-mechanical systems, liquid crystals, heaters, refractive optical elements, planar waveguides, optical fibers, etc.) for commercialization with miniaturization trends of optical devices. Herein, this review describes and classifies metasurface-integrated optical components, and subsequently discusses their promising applications with metasurface-integrated optical platforms including those of augmented/virtual reality, light detection and ranging, and sensors. In conclusion, this review presents several challenges and prospects that are prevalent in the field in order to accelerate the commercialization of metasurfaces-integrated optical platforms.

As a core optical component of the aforementioned imaging system, the two-dimensional varifocal scanning element has intensively been investigated. Although many methods have been proposed for two-dimensional varifocal scanning imaging, they often suffer from several problems, such as small varifocal range, small scanning angle, bulky size, and slow response speed. This paper proposes a novel two-dimensional varifocal scanning element actuated by dielectric elastomer, which consists of two pairs of Alvarez lenses, and a pair of decentred lenses. By applying actuation voltages on the different quadrants of the dielectric elastomers, the two pairs of Alvarez lenses can be moved laterally to change the focal length and the pair of decentred lenses can be shifted to scan the imaging object in a two-dimension direction. The validity of the proposed two-dimensional varifocal scanning imaging is verified by the experiments. The results show that the focal length variation of the proposed two-dimensional varifocal scanning element is up to 3.75 times where the maximum and minimum focal lengths are 19.5 mm and 5.2 mm respectively. The maximum scanning angle is 14.18°. The rise and fall response times are 124 ms and 203 ms, respectively. The proposed varifocal scanning element is expected to be used in the fields of microscopy, biomedicine, virtual reality, etc. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165059814"

Existing tools, such as advanced firewalls or intrusion prevention systems (IPS), cannot handle such an elevated volume of attacks because these solutions are dependent on humans. Therefore, adaptation of the current network security solutions to automated ones is more significant than ever to foster the development of the zero-touch networks and service management (ZSM) paradigm. Building on our preliminary work in this field, in this study, we provide a software-defined networking (SDN)-based framework that automates the detection and mitigation of slow-rate DDoS attacks. The framework uses deep learning (DL) to detect attacks and reinforcement learning (RL) to mitigate them. Furthermore, a network function virtualization (NFV)-assisted moving target defense (MTD) mechanism is included to amplify the effectiveness and flexibility of the solution. The framework is tested on a simulated network using open-source tools, namely Open Network Operating System (ONOS), Containernet, Apache Web Server, and Docker. The source code of a prototype of the framework is shared, which can be used and improved by interested researchers. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that RL agents learn optimal DDoS mitigation policies in different scenarios and that they quickly adapt to new conditions that vary in short periods of time. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168803383"

Utilizing family caregivers to assist with delirium management in acute care settings demonstrates improved health outcomes supporting the need for patient and family centered care. The primary aims of the study were to determine feasibility of implementing a delirium education video for caregivers of patients in an adult oncology intensive care unit and compare delirium knowledge to caregivers in a control group. Methods: A quasi-experimental design comprised of 31 family caregivers of adult patients in an oncology intensive care unit to determine feasibility of implementing a delirium education video. Results: The results demonstrate feasibility of implementing a caregiver education video in-person and virtually. While total delirium knowledge scores were not statistically significant, knowledge gained within the delirium presentation subgroup was significant (p =.05). Conclusion: This study demonstrates feasibility of implementing a caregiver education video and findings support further research in this area.

Several contributions to current regeneration practices, including exhibitions, innovative cultural products, and integrations with nearby areas, remain in the preliminary stages due to the relative youth of the Liangzhu archaeological sites and museum, while their adoption of VR and AR technologies is also limited in practice. Referencing relevant cases in the literature and an interview with a manager involved with the archaeological work on Liangzhu culture, this article provides recommendations for exhibitions that emphasise the adoption of digital and multimedia displays and simulated restorations. Meanwhile, innovative cultural products require improvements related to design and development that match customer preferences. To integrate Liangzhu culture with nearby tourist attractions, comprehensive studies are needed on the spiritual connections that local communities develop with their original living spaces and the forms of their participation in heritage conservation practices. This article also presents several technical improvements for VR and AR, such as new methods for constructing digital models and the choice of presentation medium. Potential usages for AR technology with simulated restorations, interactive activities, innovative cultural products, and new public spaces nearby have also been suggested.

A pixel structure of 3147 pixels per inch (PPI) with four sub-pixels and a single-stack white OLED with red, green, and blue color filters were used for the electrical crosstalk simulation. The results showed that the sheet resistance of the top and bottom electrodes of OLEDs rarely affected the electrical crosstalk. However, the current crosstalk ratio increased dramatically and the color gamut decreased as the sheet resistance of the common organic layer decreased. Furthermore, the color gamut of the OLED microdisplay decreased as the pixel density of the panel increased from 200 to 5000 PPI.

Although studies have evaluated these technologies, no comparisons of their effectiveness have been conducted to date. Thus, this study aims to assess the differences in effectiveness of these interventions on balance and functional mobility in the older adults. A systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) were conducted to identify the most effective interventions for improving balance and functional mobility in adults aged 60 and over. The search was conducted in five databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and Web of Science) up to June 10, 2023. The eligibility criteria were: (1) older adults, (2) functional mobility, balance, or gait as the primary outcome, (3) new technology intervention, and (4) randomized study design. New technology interventions were classified into five categories: exergaming with balance platforms or motion capture technologies, other serious gaming, interventions with wearables, and telerehabilitation. Additionally, two categories of control interventions (conventional exercises and no treatment) were extracted. The NMA was performed for the aggregated results of all outcomes, and separately for clinical functional scales, functional mobility, and gait speed results. Fifty-two RCTs with 3081 participants were included. Exergaming with motion capture was found to be statistically significant in producing a better effect than no treatment in the analysis of the functional mobility with an SMD of −0.70 (P < 0.01). The network meta-analysis revealed that exergaming with motion capture offers greater therapeutic benefits for functional mobility and balance compared to no treatment control. The effectiveness of this approach is similar to that of conventional exercises. Further RCTs are needed to provide a more definitive conclusion, particularly with respect to the effectiveness of serious games, telerehabilitation, and interventions with wearables. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168658061"

Comparative effects in conjugated SBTM conditions were not studied systematically despite potentially affecting intervention outcomes. We compared gait adaptation effects instigated by SBTM walking with respect to the type (increased\decreased speed) and the side (more/less affected) of the manipulated belt in PD. Methods: Eight individuals with PD performed four trials of SBTM walking, each consisted of baseline tied belt configuration, followed by split belt setting – either WS or BS belt's speed increased or decreased by 50% from baseline, and final tied belt configuration. Based on the disease's motor symptoms, a 'worst' side (WS) and a 'best' side (BS) were defined for each participant. Results: SB initial change in GA was significant regardless of condition (p ≤ 0.02). This change was however more pronounced for BS-decrease compared with its matching condition WS-increase (p = 0.016). Similarly, the same was observed for WS-decrease compared to BS-increase (p = 0.013). Upon returning to tied belt condition, both BS-decrease and WS-increased resulted in a significant change in GA (p = 0.04). Upper limb asymmetry followed a similar trend of GA reversal, although non-significant. Conclusions: Stronger effects on GA were obtained by decreasing the BS belt’s speed of the best side, rather than increasing the speed of the worst side. Albeit a small sample size, which limits the generalisability of these results, we propose that future clinical studies would benefit from considering such methodological planning of SBTM intervention, for maximising of intervention outcomes. Larger samples may reveal arm swinging asymmetries alterations to match SBTM adaptation patterns. Finally, further research is warranted to study post-adaption effects in order to define optimal adaptation schemes to maximise the therapeutic effect of SBTM based interventions. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165626492"

Importantly, following the virtual practice, participants held the presentation during a real university course via Zoom. We measured emotional experience, self-efficacy, and the subjective evaluation of performance at baseline, after VR practice, and after the real presentation. Additionally, participants’ performance in the real presentation was evaluated by instructors (blinded to condition). Supportive in contrast to unsupportive audiences led to more positive believes about one’s own performance, while there were no changes in beliefs in the group without audience. Importantly, practice in front of a supportive compared to unsupportive audience resulted in a more positive evaluation of speaker confidence in real-life public speaking as rated by the instructors. These results demonstrate an impact of virtual social feedback during public speaking on subsequent subjective performance evaluation. This may increase self-confidence resulting in actual improved public speaking performance in real-life. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168756178"

Previous studies assessed the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation in haemodialysis patients. This study adds to the relevance of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) applications combined with a virtual reality (VR) distraction to increase intensity, dosage, and efficiency of NMES and slow sarcopenia progression in HD patients. Methods: We conducted a 12-week multicenter prospective randomised controlled trial. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: neuromuscular electrical stimulation with or without combined virtual reality distraction or control group. Results: The final analysis included 32 haemodialysis patients (mean age of 68 ± 10 years, 26 men). Interaction effects between groups and time (12 weeks) were significant regarding serum albumin levels (p = 0.008) and left quadriceps femoris muscle (QFM) force (p = 0.026). Both endpoints were increased in the NMES compared to the CO group at the end of the intervention. The NMES group increased serum albumin levels significantly after 12 weeks. The main effect of time was an increase in mean right QFM force between beginning and end of the intervention (p = 0.021). Functional capacity improved after 12 weeks in the NMES and NMES + VR but not in the control group, with a significant difference between the three groups (p = 0.022). Weight and body mass index increased in the NMES and NMES + VR groups, albeit not significantly. The effects of VR distraction on NMES efficiency were inconclusive. Conclusion: Intradialytic NMES increases serum albumin level, functional capacity, muscle strength in lower limb and in tendency weight and body mass index of HD patients. Effects on VR distraction are inconclusive. Large-scaled follow-up studies on integrated sports programs with NMES and active training in combination with VR as distraction and motivation accelerator are needed.

Empirical research suggests a key role of operant learning mechanisms, and first experimental paradigms were developed for their investigation within a controlled laboratory setting. We introduce a new Virtual Reality paradigm to the study of pain-related behaviour and investigate pain experiences on multiple dimensions. The paradigm evaluates the effects of three-tiered heat-pain stimuli applied contingent versus non-contingent with three types of arm movements in naturalistic virtual sceneries. Behaviour, self-reported pain-related fear, pain expectancy and electrodermal activity were assessed in 42 healthy participants during an acquisition phase (contingent movement-pain association) and a modification phase (no contingent movement-pain association). Pain-associated approach behaviour, as measured by arm movements followed by a severe heat stimulus, quickly decreased in-line with the arm movement-pain contingency. Slower effects were observed in fear of movement-related pain and pain expectancy ratings. During the subsequent modification phase, the removal of the pain contingencies modified all three indices. In both phases, skin conductance responses resemble the pattern observed for approach behaviour, while skin conductance levels equal the pattern observed for the self-ratings. Our findings highlight a fast reduction in approach behaviour in the face of acute pain and inform about accompanying psychological and physiological processes. We discuss strength and limitations of our paradigm for future investigations with the ultimate goal of gaining a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in chronic pain development, maintenance, and its therapy. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168567101"

Due to the characteristic of visibility and hyperconnectivity of social media, virtual influencers' public presentations can influence their followers and how they respond to virtual influencers and similar influencers as a collective phenomenon. Through a content analysis of 517 posts and 21,724 user comments from 17 of the most popular English-speaking human-like virtual influencers on Instagram, our study investigates how virtual influencers leverage the flexibility in presenting their affect, sexual display, virtual nature, and humanness (biological senses) and how their followers respond to these dimensions accordingly. We compared if female and male virtual influencers followed gender stereotypes in their self-presentations and if the followers responded accordingly. Our findings show that the most popular virtual influencers do not seem to leverage their flexible gender identity, but often present themselves according to gender stereotypes and receive corresponding comments based on their gender. Male virtual influencers are significantly more likely to “pass” as an actual human, while female virtual influencers are more likely to disclose their virtual nature. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168803897"

Typical symptoms are - on a physical level - the consequences of an increase in sympathetic tone with cardiac stress, such as acceleration of heartbeat, increase in blood pressure, increased respiratory rate and tremor up to nausea or flush reactions. These symptoms can cause emotional distress, a reduced musical and artistical performance up to an impaired functioning. While anxiety disorders are preferably treated using cognitive-behavioral therapy with exposure, this approach is rather difficult for treating music performance anxiety since the presence of a public or professional jury is required and not easily available. The use of virtual reality (VR) could therefore display an alternative. So far, no therapy studies on music performance anxiety applying virtual reality exposure therapy have investigated the therapy outcome including cardiovascular changes as outcome parameters. Methods: This mono-center, prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial has a pre-post design with a follow-up period of 6 months. 46 professional and semi-professional musicians will be recruited and allocated randomly to an VR exposure group or a control group receiving progressive muscle relaxation training. Both groups will be treated over 4 single sessions. Music performance anxiety will be diagnosed based on a clinical interview using ICD-10 and DSM-5 criteria for specific phobia or social anxiety. A behavioral assessment test is conducted three times (pre, post, follow-up) in VR through an audition in a concert hall. Primary outcomes are the changes in music performance anxiety measured by the German Bühnenangstfragebogen and the cardiovascular reactivity reflected by heart rate variability (HRV). Secondary outcomes are changes in blood pressure, stress parameters such as cortisol in the blood and saliva, neuropeptides, and DNA-methylation. Discussion: The trial investigates the effect of VR exposure in musicians with performance anxiety compared to a relaxation technique on anxiety symptoms and corresponding cardiovascular parameters. We expect a reduction of anxiety but also a consecutive improvement of HRV with cardiovascular protective effects. Trial registration: : This study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov.

Even in recovered patients, symptoms can be persistent over weeks, termed Post-COVID. In addition to common symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, and cognitive impairments, visual impairments have been reported. Automatic classification of COVID and Post-COVID is researched based on blood samples and radiation-based procedures, among others. However, a symptom-oriented assessment for visual impairments is still missing. Thus, we propose a Virtual Reality environment in which stereoscopic stimuli are displayed to test the patient’s stereopsis performance. While performing the visual tasks, the eyes’ gaze and pupil diameter are recorded. We collected data from 15 controls and 20 Post-COVID patients in a study. Therefrom, we extracted features of three main data groups, stereopsis performance, pupil diameter, and gaze behavior, and trained various classifiers. The Random Forest classifier achieved the best result with 71% accuracy. The recorded data support the classification result showing worse stereopsis performance and eye movement alterations in Post-COVID.

Avatar therapy (AT) is a virtual reality-based therapy currently being developed and studied for patients suffering from treatment resistant schizophrenia. Considering the importance of identifying emotions in therapeutical processes and their impact on the therapeutic outcome, an exploration of such emotions is needed. Methods: The aim of this study is to identify the underlying emotions at the core of the patient-Avatar interaction during AT by content analysis of immersive sessions transcripts and audio recordings. A content analysis of AT transcripts and audio recordings using iterative categorization was conducted for 16 patients suffering from TRS who underwent AT between 2017 and 2022 (128 transcripts and 128 audio recordings). An iterative categorization technique was conducted to identify the different emotions expressed by the patient and the Avatar during the immersive sessions. Results: The following emotions were identified in this study: Anger, Contempt/ Disgust, Fear, Sadness, Shame/ Embarrassment, Interest, Surprise, Joy and Neutral. Patients expressed mostly neutral, joy and anger emotions whereas the Avatar expressed predominantly interest, disgust/contempt, and neutral emotions. Conclusions: This study portrays a first qualitative insight on the emotions that are expressed in AT and serves as a steppingstone for further investigation in the role of emotions in the therapeutic outcomes of AT. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161912951"

Since virtualization technology can greatly enhance the simulation efficiency by providing virtual models to simulate the behaviors of real devices, this paper designs and realizes a real-time simulation platform on general-purpose operating systems with the virtualization technology such that embedded applications would be correctly and efficiently debugged and tested on the general-purpose operating systems. The proposed simulation platform contains four layers named hardware resource, virtualization, virtual runtime environment, and interface adaptation, allowing dynamic debugging and testing of embedded applications without requiring the actual presence of real devices.

Virtual reality (VR) has been used as a therapeutic tool for patients to participate in activities in a safe environment, engage in multisensory experiences, and improve motivation and interest in rehabilitation. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of fully immersive VR exergames with dual-task components in patients with PD. Methods: We developed VR exergames (go/no-go punch game, go/no-go stepping game, and number punch game) to improve habitual behavior control using motor–cognitive dual-task performance in patients with PD. The participants underwent 10 sessions 2–3 times a week, consisting of 30 min per session. The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, Timed Up and Go test (TUG) under single- and dual-task (cognitive and physical) conditions, Berg balance scale (BBS), Stroop test, trail-making test, and digit span were evaluated before and after intervention. The Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) was used to assess VR cybersickness. Usability was assessed using a self-reported questionnaire. Results: Twelve patients were enrolled and completed the entire training session. The mean age of participants was 73.83 ± 6.09 years; mean disease duration was 128.83 ± 76.96 months. The Hoehn and Yahr stages were 2.5 in seven patients and 3 in five patients. A significant improvement was observed in BBS and Stroop color–word test (p = 0.047 and p = 0.003, respectively). TUG time and dual-task interferences showed positive changes, but these changes were not statistically significant. The median SSQ total score was 28.05 (IQR: 29.92), 13.09 (IQR: 11.22), and 35.53 (IQR: 52.36) before, after the first session, and after the final session, respectively; the differences were not significant. Overall satisfaction with the intervention was 6.0 (IQR: 1.25) on a 7-point Likert-type scale. Conclusions: Fully immersive VR exergames combined with physical and cognitive tasks may be used for rehabilitation of patients with PD without causing serious adverse effects.

Methods: People (aged 50) with osteoporosis in an elderly care institution in Anhui Province June 2020 to October 2021 were selected and randomly divided into VR group (n = 25) and control group (n = 25). In VR group, the virtual reality rehabilitation training system was used for training, while control group was treated with traditional fall prevention exercise intervention. The changes of Berg Balance Scale (BBS), timed up and go test (TUGT), functional gait assessment (FGA), bone mineral density (BMD) and falls during 12 months of training were compared between the two groups. Results: BBS and FGA were positively correlated with BMD of the lumbar vertebrae and femoral neck, and TUGT was negatively correlated with BMD of the lumbar vertebrae and femoral neck. After 12 months of training, the BBS score, TUGT evaluation and FGA evaluation of the two groups were significantly improved compared with those prior to training (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD between the two groups 6 months after the intervention. The femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD of the VR group improved, and it was significantly higher than that of the control group 12 months after the intervention. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in terms of the incidence of adverse events between the two groups. Conclusion: VR training can improve anti-fall ability and increase femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD and can effectively prevent and reduce the risk of injury among elderly people with osteoporosis. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163748085"

Virtual reality (VR) treatment approaches have increasingly been studied. Before clinical implementation, it is necessary to evaluate the treatment effect of VR applications. The objective is to evaluate the treatment effect of virtual reality applications in the treatment of anxiety disorders compared to conventional therapy. Methods: A systematic literature review with meta-analysis was conducted. Four databases were used to identify randomized controlled trials published between April 2011 and April 2021 which compare VR applications with non-VR interventions or waiting lists. Study characteristics, pre- and post-treatment data were extracted. Hedges g was calculated as effect size. Primary outcome was anxiety symptoms. Results: Data from 17 studies from 827 participants was extracted. The studies examined specific phobia (n = 9), social anxiety disorder (n = 4), agoraphobia (n = 2) and panic disorder (n = 2). 16 out of 17 studies used head-mounted displays as VR application. A non-significant effect size with significant heterogeneity was observed in favor of the use of VR applications in anxiety symptoms (g, 0.33; 95%-CI, −0.20–0.87). Compared to passive control groups, VR applications are associated significant with lower anxiety symptoms (g, 1.29; 95%-CI, 0.68–1.90). Limitations: The study and patient characteristics varied between the individual studies which is reflected in a high statistical heterogeneity of the effect sizes. Conclusions: The added value of VR applications over waiting-list or psychoeducation only control groups is obvious. VR applications can be used as part of the treatment of anxiety disorders, especially when conventional therapy is unavailable. © 2023 The Authors","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164733667"

People will be led to utilize virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies in their daily lives, hobbies, numerous types of entertainment, and employment. Medical augmented reality has evolved with applications ranging from medical education to picture-guided surgery. Moreover, a bulk of research is focused on clinical applications, with the majority of research devoted to surgery or intervention, followed by rehabilitation and treatment applications. Numerous studies have also looked into the use of augmented reality in medical education and training. Methods: Using the databases Semantic Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect, a scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. To find other articles, a manual search was also carried out in Google Scholar. This study presents studies carried out over the previous 14 years (from 2009 to 2023) in detail. We classify this area of study into the following categories: (1) AR and VR in surgery, which is presented in the following subsections: subsection A: MR in neurosurgery; subsection B: spine surgery; subsection C: oral and maxillofacial surgery; and subsection D: AR-enhanced human-robot interaction; (2) AR and VR in medical education presented in the following subsections; subsection A: medical training; subsection B: schools and curriculum; subsection C: XR in Biomedicine; (3) AR and VR for rehabilitation presented in the following subsections; subsection A: stroke rehabilitation during COVID-19; subsection B: cancer and VR, and (4) Millimeter-wave and MIMO systems for AR and VR. Results: In total, 77 publications were selected based on the inclusion criteria. Four distinct AR and/or VR applications groups could be differentiated: AR and VR in surgery (N = 21), VR and AR in Medical Education (N = 30), AR and VR for Rehabilitation (N = 15), and Millimeter-Wave and MIMO Systems for AR and VR (N = 7), where N is number of cited studies. We found that the majority of research is devoted to medical training and education, with surgical or interventional applications coming in second. The research is mostly focused on rehabilitation, therapy, and clinical applications. Moreover, the application of XR in MIMO has been the subject of numerous research. Conclusion: Examples of these diverse fields of applications are displayed in this review as follows: (1) augmented reality and virtual reality in surgery; (2) augmented reality and virtual reality in medical education; (3) augmented reality and virtual reality for rehabilitation; and (4) millimeter-wave and MIMO systems for augmented reality and virtual reality. © 2023, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166385620"

Here, we developed a novel experimental paradigm to study these affective forecasting biases under laboratory conditions using subjective (arousal and valence) and autonomic measures (skin conductance responses, SCRs, and heart rate). Thirty participants predicted their emotional responses to 15 unpleasant, 15 neutral, and 15 pleasant scenarios (affective forecasting phase) to which they were then exposed in virtual reality (emotional experience phase). Results showed that participants anticipated more extreme arousal and valence scores than they actually experienced for unpleasant and pleasant scenarios. The emotional experience phase was characterized by classic autonomic patterns, i.e., higher SCRs for emotionally arousing scenarios and greater peak cardiac acceleration for pleasant scenarios. During the affective forecasting phase, we found only a moderate association between arousal scores and SCRs and no valence-dependent modulation of cardiac activity. This paradigm opens up new perspectives for investigating affective forecasting abilities under lab-controlled conditions, notably in psychiatric disorders with anxious anticipations. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161402985"

VR is a technology that uses a headset to simulate a reality in which the user is immersed in a virtual environment, creating the impression that the user is physically present in this virtual space. Despite the potential added value of virtual reality technology in healthcare, its uptake in clinical practice is still in its infancy and challenges arise in the implementation of VR. Effective implementation could improve the adoption, uptake, and impact of VR. However, these implementation procedures still seem to be understudied in practice. This scoping review aimed to examine the current state of affairs in the implementation of VR technology in healthcare settings and to provide an overview of factors related to the implementation of VR. Methods: To give an overview of relevant literature, a scoping review was undertaken of articles published up until February 2022, guided by the methodological framework of Arksey and O’Malley (2005). The databases Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were systematically searched to identify records that highlighted the current state of affairs regarding the implementation of VR in healthcare settings. Information about each study was extracted using a structured data extraction form. Results: Of the 5523 records identified, 29 were included in this study. Most studies focused on barriers and facilitators to implementation, highlighting similar factors related to the behavior of adopters of VR and the practical resources the organization should arrange for. However, few studies focus on systematic implementation and on using a theoretical framework to guide implementation. Despite the recommendation of using a structured, multi-level implementation intervention to support the needs of all involved stakeholders, there was no link between the identified barriers and facilitators, and specific implementation objectives or suitable strategies to overcome these barriers in the included articles. Conclusion: To take the implementation of VR in healthcare to the next level, it is important to ensure that implementation is not studied in separate studies focusing on one element, e.g., healthcare provider-related barriers, as is common in current literature. Based on the results of this study, we recommend that the implementation of VR entails the entire process, from identifying barriers to developing and employing a coherent, multi-level implementation intervention with suitable strategies. This implementation process could be supported by implementation frameworks and ideally focus on behavior change of stakeholders such as healthcare providers, patients, and managers. This in turn might result in increased uptake and use of VR technologies that are of added value for healthcare practice. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165286452"

Virtual reality simulation training is helpful, but how and when novices should progress to patient-based training has yet to be established. To date, there is no assessment tool for credentialing novice endoscopists prior to clinical practice. The aim of this study was to develop such an assessment tool based on metrics provided by the simulator. The metrics used for the assessment tool should be able to discriminate between novices, intermediates, and experts and include essential checklist items for patient safety. Methods: The validation process was conducted based on the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing. An expert panel decided upon three essential checklist items for patient safety based on Lawshe’s method: perforation, hazardous tension to the bowel wall, and cecal intubation. A power calculation was performed. In this study, the Simbionix GI Mentor II simulator was used. Metrics with discriminatory ability were identified with variance analysis and combined to form an aggregate score. Based on this score and the essential items, pass/fail standards were set and reliability was tested. Results: Twenty-four participants (eight novices, eight intermediates, and eight expert endoscopists) performed two simulated colonoscopies. Four metrics with discriminatory ability were identified. The aggregate score ranged from 4.2 to 51.2 points. Novices had a mean score of 10.00 (SD 5.13), intermediates 24.63 (SD 7.91), and experts 30.72 (SD 11.98). The difference in score between novices and the other two groups was statistically significant (p<0.01). Although expert endoscopists had a higher score, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.40). Reliability was good (Cronbach’s alpha=0.86). A pass/fail score was defined at 17.1 points with correct completion of three essential checklist items, resulting in three experts and three intermediates failing and one novice passing the assessment. Conclusion: We established a valid and reliable assessment tool with a pass/fail standard on the simulator. We suggest using the assessment after simulation-based training before commencing work-based learning. © 2023, Society in Europe for Simulation Applied to Medicine (SESAM) and BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168344757"

This study aims to identify the factors influencing Chinese clinical medical postgraduates on their intention to use the 3D gastroscopic model constructed based on VR technology using Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Students’ demographic factors are also taken into consideration. Methods: All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines. Data were collected from clinical medical postgraduates students in China using stratified sampling. A total of 292 questionnaires including valid responses were used in this study. Data were processed using Amos 24.0 and SPSS 26.0 software and the statistical analysis technique was based on structural equation modeling (SEM). Results: The results showed that different from the mediator of home location and year of clinical learning, mediator of gender, university kind and graduate degree did not affect the behavioral intention. In addition, performance expectancy, facilitating condition, and social influence directly and indirectly have effect on behavioral intention. Also, the significance between social influence and performance expectancy, social influence and effort expectancy were verified. Conclusions: This study manifested that the proposed framework based on the UTAUT had explanatory power to identify the factors influencing the students’ behavioral intention to use the 3D gastroscopic model constructed based on VR technology. Whereas, an important variable of effort expectancy in the frame of the SEM were not certified, thereby indicating that particular attention should be paid to this variable by universities and teachers before applying 3D gastroscopic model constructed based on VR technology in teaching. Added preparatory work is required such as explaining the basic knowledge of the operating steps of VR model and make students adequately understand its accessibility, which can probably improve the intentions of them to use it. The positive effects of social influence on performance expectancy and effort expectancy we proposed was also verified in this study, which provided a direction for future research. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167514489"

Tf-PT focuses on processing and modulating trauma memories. Not all patients benefit, however, and there is room for improvement of efficacy. Pharmacologically augmenting trauma memory modulation in the context of tf-PT may help optimise treatment outcome. To systematically review effects of pharmacologically augmented memory modulation in the context of tf-PT for PTSD (PROSPERO preregistration ID: CRD42021230623). We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of psychotherapy treatment for PTSD. We included placebo-controlled studies that augmented at least one treatment session pharmacologically targeting memory extinction or reconsolidation. We calculated post-treatment between group (pharmacological augmentation vs placebo control) effect sizes of PTSD symptom severity. We included 13 RCTs. There was large heterogeneity in augmentation procedure and methodological quality. Four studies showed significantly greater PTSD symptom reduction in the pharmacological augmentation group (propranolol, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, D-cycloserine) compared to placebo. Seven studies showed no significant effect of pharmacological augmentation compared to placebo (D-cycloserine, rapamycin, mifepristone, propranolol, mifepristone combined with D-cycloserine, methylene blue). Two studies showed significantly smaller PTSD symptom reduction in the pharmacological augmentation group (D-cycloserine, dexamethasone) compared to placebo. Results of pharmacological augmentation were mixed overall and heterogenous for the pharmacological agents tested in more than one study.

Among existing therapeutic devices, none has been specifically designed to promote the application of principles underlying evidence-based motor skill learning interventions. Consequently, evidence is lacking regarding the effectiveness of virtual-based sessions in motor function rehabilitation with respect to promoting the transfer of motor improvements into daily life activities. We tested the effectiveness of implementing a recently developed virtual device (REAtouch®), specifically designed to enable the application of therapeutic motor skill learning principles, during a Hand Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy Including Lower Extremities (HABIT-ILE) intervention. Methods: Forty children with unilateral cerebral palsy (5–18 years; MACS I-III; GMFCS I-II) were randomly assigned to a control group or a “REAtouch®” experimental group for a 90-h HABIT-ILE day-camp intervention (two weeks). Children in the REAtouch® group spent nearly half of their one-on-one therapeutic time using the REAtouch®. Participants underwent three testing sessions: the week before (T1), after intervention (T2), and at three months follow-up (T3). The primary outcome was the Assisting Hand Assessment (T3–T1; blinded). Secondary outcomes measured uni-bimanual hand function, stereognosis, gait endurance, daily life abilities, and functional goals. Accelerometers and a manual report of daily activities served to document therapeutic dosage and treatment characteristics. We used one-way RMANOVA to compare the efficacies of the two interventions, and non-inferiority analyses to contrast changes in the “REAtouch®” group versus the “HABIT-ILE” control group. Results: We found significant improvements in both groups for most of the outcome measures (p < 0.05). There was significant non-inferiority of changes in the REAtouch® group for upper extremities motor function, functional goals attainment, and abilities in daily life activities (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Use of the REAtouch® device during HABIT-ILE showed non-inferior efficacy compared to the conventional evidence-based HABIT-ILE intervention in children with unilateral cerebral palsy. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using this virtual device in a high dosage camp model, and establishes the possibility of applying the therapeutic principles of motor skill learning during specifically designed virtual-based sessions.

Results show no significant benefit nor detriment from learning with 360° videos. We also found few factors which significantly moderated the effect.

We selected relevant articles from eight databases from 2011 to 2022 and extracted articles on cognitive ability (general cognition, mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) et al.), mobility (modified Barthel index (MBI), Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA), Berg balance scale (BBS), functional independence measure motor (FIM MOT)), and emotion (depression/anxiety). Twenty-nine studies including 1311 participants were included in the analysis. In the results, virtual reality games were more effective in improving overall cognitive function in stroke patients compared to conventional therapies. In addition, the intervention group in the MMSE (SMD = 0.6, 95%CI = 0.26–0.95, P = 0.0007), MoCA (MD = 1.97, 95%CI = 1.3–2.64, P < 0.00001), and attention test (MD = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.01–0.49, P < 0.00001) scores were also higher. In terms of physical function, MBI (SMD = 0.61, 95%CI = 0.14–1.08, P = 0.01), FMA (SMD = 0.47, 95%CI = 0.02–0.93, P = 0.04), BBS (SMD = 0.78, 95%CI = 0.42–1.15, P < 0.0001), and FIM MOT (MD = 5.87, 95%CI = 2.57–9.17, P = 0.0005) indicators showed better results. It is also observed that virtual reality games can effectively relieve depression and improve mental health in stroke patients. Sports game training, especially with VR equipment, had a positive impact on improving the cognitive performance, mobility, and emotional state of stroke patients compared to a control group. Although the improvement in cognitive ability is relatively low, the effect of improving physical activity and depression is obvious. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164131515"

Physical disabilities, impaired social engagement, and environmental stress are also common in LTCF which exacerbate the decline of the mental well-being of older people living in LTCF. Protective elements, including nature-based, reminiscence, outdoor, and group activities, are known to be effective to promote the mental well-being of older people living in LTCF. However, limited by their physical disabilities and poor social support, older people living in LTCF are not likely to benefit from these effective measures. Virtual reality has been proven to be feasible to be environmentally unrestricted to providing LTCF residents with all protective elements promoting mental well-being. However, its effects on the mental well-being of LTCF residents living with physical disabilities are unclear. Methods: This study employs a single-blinded, two-parallel-group (intervention-to-control group ratio = 1:1), non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants are aged 60 years or above, LTCF residents, and living with physical disabilities. The study will be conducted in LTCF.

Through VR-based rehabilitation, patients can improve their motor skills in a safe and stress-free environment, making it an attractive alternative to traditional in-person rehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to provide the most recent and convincing evidence on the rehabilitative effects of VR technology compared with conventional treatments. Methods: Two investigators systematically searched Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PEDro, and the Cochrane Library from their inception until May 31, 2022, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of VR training with that of conventional treatment for patients with PD. Studies were selected based on the patient, intervention, comparator, and outcome criteria and assessed for the risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. Meta-analysis was conducted by pooling mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. Results: A total of 14 RCTs, involving 524 participants, were included in the meta-analysis. The results indicated that VR-based rehabilitation significantly improved balance function, as measured using the Berg balance scale (BBS) and activities-specific balance confidence. However, no statistically significant differences in gait ability, activities of daily living, motor function, and quality of life were observed between the experimental and control groups. Subgroup analysis revealed that combination therapy affected heterogeneity in the BBS analysis. Meta-regression analysis demonstrated a significant positive relationship, indicating that more recent studies have shown greater improvements in balance function. Conclusion: This study’s findings suggest that VR-based rehabilitation is a promising intervention for improving balance function in patients for PD compared with conventional treatment, and recent research supports its efficacy. However, future research should focus on conducting long-term follow-up studies and developing standardized protocols to comprehensively establish this intervention’s potential benefits. © 2023, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165346670"

These periprocedural outcomes can be overcome by providing a distraction using virtual reality (VR), decreasing their perception. VR has proved effective in reducing pediatric pain and anxiety; however, limited studies have confirmed its effectiveness in adults. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of VR, as opposed to standard care, in reducing periprocedural pain and anxiety in adults. Methods: A systematic search of randomized controlled trials was conducted using the databases of MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Scopus. Trials involving patients (> 18 years) undergoing elective medical procedures conducted with or without local anesthesia and participating in VR therapy were included. Primary outcomes were pre-procedural anxiety, post-procedural anxiety, and intra-procedural pain. Pre-procedural pain, post-procedural pain, and intra-procedural anxiety were secondary outcomes. Results: Data from 10 studies shortlisted for inclusion revealed no significant association between the use of VR and lower pre-procedural anxiety compared to standard care (p > 0.05) (SMD = -0.02, 95% CI = -0.18 – 0.14, P = 0.81) but demonstrated that the use of VR was significantly associated with a reduction in post-procedural anxiety (SMD = -0.73, 95% CI = -1.08 – -0.39, P < 0.0001), intra-procedural pain (SMD = -0.61, 95% CI = -1.18 – -0.04, P = 0.04), and post-procedural pain (SMD = -0.25, 95% CI = -0.44 – -0.05, P = 0.01). Conclusion: The use of VR caused a significant reduction in post-procedural anxiety, intra-procedural pain, and post-procedural pain in adults undergoing medical procedures, although the findings were insignificant concerning pre-procedural anxiety. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167370726"

Through a triple-layer structure combined with a dielectric bilayer and a rough-surface Ag nanowire (Ag NW) electrode layer, the inherent capacitance and interfacial trapping density of the electrostatic interface has been strongly enhanced, contributing to an unprecedented charge storage capability. The electrostatic charge density of the interface reached 1671.10 μC·m−2 with a charge-keeping rate of 96.91% after 1000 non-contact operation cycles, which can finally realize oculogyric detection with an angular resolution of 5°.

Here, we investigated whether space perception can be influenced by an experimentally induced change in perceived self-location. To dissociate real and apparent body positions, we used the full-body illusion. In this illusion, participants see a distant avatar being stroked in virtual reality while their own physical back is simultaneously stroked. After experiencing the discrepancy between the seen and the felt location of the stroking, participants report a forward drift in self-location toward the avatar. We wondered whether this illusion-induced forward drift in self-location would affect where we perceive objects in depth. We applied a psychometric measurement in which participants compared the position of a probe against a reference sphere in a two-alternative forced choice task. We found a significant improvement in task performance for the right visual field, indicated by lower just-noticeable differences, i.e., participants were better at judging the differences of the two spheres in depth. Our results suggest that the full-body illusion is able to facilitate depth perception at least unilaterally, implying that depth perception is influenced by perceived self-location. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163759870"

One promising option to narrow this treatment gap is Internet-based psychotherapy, which has been shown particularly effective in guided formats. Still, there remains room for improvement to make these digital therapies more accessible, cost-efficient, and aligned with best practices for in-person interventions (e.g., exposure). The smartphone app “Invirto – Treatment for Anxiety” offers digitally guided, evidence-based treatment of panic disorders including virtual reality (VR) for exposure therapy. The aim present study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, and acceptance of Invirto in comparison to a care-as-usual (CAU) control group. Methods: We plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial with two conditions (intervention vs. CAU), three assessment times via online surveys (t0: baseline; t1: 3 months after baseline; t2: follow-up assessment 6 months after baseline), and a total of 128 participants with a clinical diagnosis of panic disorder (symptoms must be experienced ≥ 1 year). Recruitment will take place via email, phone, and the study website. The primary outcome will be the change in anxiety symptoms as measured by Beck’s Anxiety Inventory from t0 to t1. Secondary outcomes will be the change in anxiety symptoms (measured by the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale, PAS; Questionnaire on panic-related Anxieties, Cognitions and Avoidance, ACA), depressive symptoms (measured by the Beck-Depression-Inventory, BDI-II), treatment satisfaction (measured by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, CSQ-8; Treatment Adherence Perception Questionnaire, TAPQ-adapt; Positive and Negative Effects of Psychotherapy Scale, PANEPS-I), psychological flexibility (measured by the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II, AAQ-II), and dissociation during VR exposure (measured by an adapted version of the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, PDEQ-adapt). Participants in the intervention group will receive access to the intervention (Invirto) right after t0, while the CAU group will receive access to Invirto after t1. We expect a larger change in both the primary and secondary outcomes from t0 to t1 in the intervention group in comparison to the CAU group. Discussion: This study is one of the first to evaluate an Internet-based intervention for people with panic disorder that includes self-application of VR exposure therapy. The findings are expected to extend the body of knowledge about effective Internet-based treatment options for people with panic disorder. The empirical and clinical implications and the limitations of the study are discussed.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of serious games specifically developed for the MYO Armband® capture sensor in improving forearm and wrist mobility, UL muscle strength, dexterity, fatigue, functionality, quality of life, satisfaction, adverse effects and compliance. Methods: A double-blinded (allocation concealment was performed by a blinded investigator and by blinding for assessors) randomised controlled trial was conducted. The sample was randomised into two groups: an experimental group that received treatment based on UL serious games designed by the research team and controlled by the MYO Armband® gesture capture sensor, along with conventional rehabilitation and a control group that received the same conventional rehabilitation for the UL. Both groups received two 60-min sessions per week over an eight-week period. Wrist range of motion (goniometry), grip muscle strength (Jamar® dynamometer), coordination and gross UL dexterity (Box and Block Test), fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), functionality (ABILHAND), quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29), adverse effects (Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, SSQ), perceived workload (NASA-Task load index), satisfaction (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8), Satisfaction with Technology Scale, System Usability Scale (SUS) and QUEST 2.0) and compliance (attendance) were assessed in both groups pre-treatment, post-treatment and during a follow-up period of 2 weeks without receiving any treatment. Results: Significant differences were observed in the experimental group compared to the control group in the assessment of forearm supination (p =.004) and grip strength (p =.004). Adverse effects were minimal (SSQ: 7/100 points) and perceived workload was low (NASA-Task Load Index: 25/100 points) in the experimental group. The MYO Armband® technology proved to be useful for the participants (SUS: 80.66/100) and the satisfaction scales received high scores (QUEST 2.0: 59.4/70 points; Satisfaction with Technology: 84.36/100 points). There were significant differences between the groups in terms of attendance percentage (p =.029). Conclusions: An experimental protocol using MYO Armband®-based serious games designed for UL rehabilitation showed improvements in active wrist range of motion and handgrip strength in patients with MS, with high satisfaction, minimal adverse effects and workload and excellent compliance.

It plays a role in the tissue metabolism of neuroactive and vasoactive amines as well as the oxidative deamination of xenobiotic and biogenic amines. However, overexpression of the receptor reduced apoptosis in cells, resulting in the progress of prostate sarcoma. Therefore, various kinds of MAOB antagonists are often used to fix an apoptosis mechanism that makes it hard to get rid of cancer from live tissues. Moreover, chemical compounds that have been discovered to be MAOB inhibitors to date exhibit side effects that are causing problems in chemotherapy treatment. The study aims to discover new purchasable compound that induces apoptosis by allowing caspases to operate at their maximum efficiency and is low toxic. Methods: With the assistance of virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation (MD), a structure-based pharmacophore model of the protein active site cavity was made. Twenty hits were found, and then a molecular docking strategy was used to choose four molecules to study in more depth. MD simulations were used to check the stability of the four compounds, and they were all shown to be stable when bound to the target protein. Results: Four newly discovered compounds, included with ZINC ID Such as ZINC12143050, ZINC08301324, ZINC16743012, and ZINC64165826 with binding scores of − 11.7, − 11.4, − 11.2 and − 11.1 kcal/mol, respectively, may serve as lead compounds for the treatment of prostate cancer associated with MAOB; however, further evaluation through wet lab is needed to determine the compounds effectiveness. Conclusion: A structure-based model was initially developed, followed by molecular docking, ADMET analysis, and MD simulation. The top four natural compounds identified in the A-to-Z virtual screening process could serve as lead molecules in the fight against prostate cancer. © 2023, The Egyptian Society of Human Genetics.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168465755"

Methods: We obtained spherical silicone molds, mannequins, and spray material from an internet-based vendor and combined them with expired surgical instruments to complete the simulator. Vitreoretinal experts confirmed the practicality of the simulator after simulated vitrectomy, and the results of the questionnaires were confirmed by nonvitreoretinal experts. Results: Vitreoretinal experts observed that the simulated eyeball and the actual eyeball were similar in size and rigidity and that the intraocular practice swing seemed to be useful for the prevention of complications. The semitransparency and open-sky structure of the silicone material ensured visibility. The simulated membrane, which was spray glue, provided an excellent peeling sensation. In the results of the nonvitreoretinal experts’ questionnaires, the average scores of all items were generally high, which supported the claims of the simulator’s usefulness. Conclusion: This report describes the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of our custom-made simulator and its contribution in creating an ideal training environment that does not necessitate travel to special facilities that offer a large number of pig eyes and vitreous surgical machines. The simple shape seems to allow many possibilities, and further verification at multiple facilities is necessary. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164429058"

The current study demonstrates the role of water in small molecule binding to hTS in mediating protein-ligand interactions.

Recently, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), virtual reality tools, and machine learning models have been increasingly applied to the care of older patients to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and interventions. However, so far, the methodological limitations of studies in this field have prevented to generalize data to real-word. This review systematically overviews the research designs used by studies applying technologies for the assessment and treatment of aging-related syndromes in older people. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, records from PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were systematically screened to select original articles in which interventional or observational designs were used to study technologies’ applications in samples of frail, comorbid, or multimorbid patients. Results: Thirty-four articles met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies used diagnostic accuracy designs to test assessment procedures or retrospective cohort designs to build predictive models. A minority were randomized or non-randomized interventional studies. Quality evaluation revealed a high risk of bias for observational studies, while a low risk of bias for interventional studies. Conclusions: The majority of the reviewed articles use an observational design mainly to study diagnostic procedures and suffer from a high risk of bias.

Although, inherent limitations such as the difficulty of testing the products “first-hand” before a purchase can compromise consumers’ trust in online purchases. Virtual Reality (VR) has been investigated as a tool to solve limitations in several fields and how we can harness its potential to improve the overall user experience. This study analysed how immersive VR (IVR) could solve these limitations by allowing consumers to test products beforehand. We have studied how the Novelty Factor (evaluated by the users’ past VR experience) and Immersive Tendencies correlate with the users’ Purchase Intention and Memory (how well they remember the product’s characteristics). We have analysed a sample of 38 participants (21 males) from 18 to 28 years old. Participants experienced a refrigerator with an interactive touchscreen in an IVR setup and were guided through its functionalities. Results indicated that memory of the product’s characteristics was positively correlated with how recently they experienced VR. No correlations were found in the female sample. A negative correlation between Purchase Intention and Memory of the product’s characteristics was found in the male sample. We concluded that IVR applications could become helpful for both consumers and online shops in an e-commerce context regardless of the Novelty Factor and Immersive Tendencies of consumers. However, differences between genders should be further investigated. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164753976"

The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between regular physical activity performed with the use of virtual reality and the occurrence of symptoms of anxiety and depression in hemodialysis patients. The study involved 85 patients from the dialysis station at the Department of Nephrology, Transplantology and Internal Medicine PUM. The examined patients were randomly divided into study group and control group. The study group consisted of patients undergoing renal replacement therapy by hemodialysis, whose task was to perform VR exercises using the prototype of the NefroVR system for 20 min during hemodialysis. The control group consisted of patients undergoing renal replacement therapy by hemodialysis who were not assigned an intervention. An intragroup analysis was performed for the Beck and GAD scales. After the end of the exercise cycle in the study group there was a decrease in the score while in the control group there was an increase in comparison to the first result. The research showed that after a 3-month exercises on a bicycle with the use of low-intensity virtual reality, a decrease in depression symptoms measured by the Beck Depression Inventory was observed. The research showed that regular physical activity using virtual reality may be associated with a reduction in the occurrence of anxiety and depression symptoms in patients included in the chronic hemodialysis program. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166085427"

Our app targets contextual sensory integration (C.S.I.) where patients are immersed in safe, increasingly challenging environments while practicing various tasks (e.g., turning, walking). The purpose of this pilot study was to establish the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial comparing C.S.I. training to traditional vestibular rehabilitation. Methods: Thirty patients with vestibular dysfunction completed the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC), Visual Vertigo Analog Scale (VVAS), Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG), and Four-Square Step Test (FSST). Following initial assessment, the patients were randomized into 8 weeks (once per week in clinic + home exercise program) of traditional vestibular rehabilitation or C.S.I. training. Six patients had to stop participation due to the covid-19 pandemic, 6 dropped out for other reasons (3 from each group). Ten patients in the traditional group and 8 in the C.S.I group completed the study. We applied an intention to treat analysis. Results: Following intervention, we observed a significant main effect of time with no main effect of group or group by time interaction for the DHI (mean difference − 18.703, 95% CI [-28.235, -9.172], p = 0.0002), ABC (8.556, [0.938, 16.174], p = 0.028), VVAS, (-13.603, [-25.634, -1.573], p = 0.027) and the FGA (6.405, [4.474, 8.335], p < 0.0001). No changes were observed for TUG and FSST. Conclusion: Patients’ symptoms and function improved following either vestibular rehabilitation method. C.S.I training appeared comparable but not superior to traditional rehabilitation.

Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to introduce this paradigm into surgical training programs. However, the steep learning curve of RAS remains a problem that hinders the development and widespread use of this surgical paradigm. For this reason, it is important to be able to train surgeons in the use of RAS procedures. RAS involves distinctive features that makes its learning different to other minimally invasive surgical procedures. One of these features is that the surgeons operate using a stereoscopic console. Therefore, it is necessary to perform RAS training stereoscopically. This article presents a mixed-reality (MR) tool for the stereoscopic visualization, annotation and collaborative display of RAS surgical procedures. The tool is an MR application because it can display real stereoscopic content and augment it with virtual elements (annotations) properly registered in 3D and tracked over time. This new tool allows the registration of surgical procedures, teachers (experts) and students (trainees), so that the teacher can share a set of videos with their students, annotate them with virtual information and use a shared virtual pointer with the students. The students can visualize the videos within a web environment using their personal mobile phones or a desktop stereo system. The use of the tool has been assessed by a group of 15 surgeons during a robotic-surgery master’s course. The results show that surgeons consider that this tool can be very useful in RAS training. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167451887"

However, there is a lack of cataract surgeons globally, and efficient and evidence-based training of new surgeons is needed. In order to investigate the validity of simulator metrics, we included three groups of participants: (1) MSICS novices who were ophthalmologists with no cataract surgery experience, (2) MSICS novices who were experienced phacoemulsification cataract surgeons, but with no MSICS experience, and (3) experienced phacoemulsification and MSICS surgeons. The evaluation included 11 steps of the MSICS procedure, and all simulator metrics for those steps were reviewed. Of the 55 initial metrics, 30 showed high positive discriminative ability. A test passing score of 20 out of 30 was established, and one of 15 novices with no MSICS experience (mean score 15.5) and 7 out of 10 experienced MSICS surgeons (mean score 22.7) passed the test.

Therefore, in this systematic review, our aim was to investigate and evaluate the available virtual reality tools for dental implants and their effectiveness. Materials and methods: Studies published up to 01/30/2023 which report the applications of using virtual reality technology in dental implants, were reviewed in three databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. All studies with evidence reporting the role of virtual reality technology in the field of dental implants were included in our analyses, written in English and published in peer-reviewed form, are included. Theoretical articles, and letters that did not provide original data, as well as studies that reported incomplete information, were excluded. Two reviewers independently assessed search results, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the included studies, and decisive agreement was reached by discussion and consultation with the third researcher. Narrative synthesis was undertaken to summarize and report the findings. Results: Out of 1633 initial search results, nine were included in the present study based on the inclusion criteria. The focus of seven studies was on teaching and learning, and two studies have examined the implant planning procedure. The most commonly used hardware and software were head-mounted display and Unity3D, respectively. In almost all studies, the results showed that the use of virtual reality-based systems improves and enhances the skills of users, including dental students and specialists. Conclusions: Our findings showed that VR is an effective method for teaching and planning the implant process. Although the use of VR technology is limited for various reasons such as cost, it can increase the skills of dental professionals in performing dental implants. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168908487"

Despite its increasing popularity, how VFR technology influences different consumer groups is hitherto unknown. Neglecting such nuances may significantly undermine VFR effectiveness. From a large-scale field experiment with real-world transactional data and five laboratory experiments, the authors document the asymmetric effects of VFR use conditional on consumer body types, characterize the theoretical underpinnings, and identify a systematic set of managerially actionable moderators that can mitigate adverse effects. Specifically, while VFR use enhances product evaluations and purchases among consumers with relatively low body mass index (BMI) levels, it negatively influences responses from high-BMI consumers due to self-image threat induced by avatars that resemble consumers’ own bodies. To cope with self-image threat, high-BMI consumers tend to shift the blame to the apparel item, resulting in negative product responses. The authors identify four feasible solutions to alleviate the negative responses among high-BMI users of VFRs, namely, promoting diversified beauty standards, featuring mannequin faces for VFR avatars, providing consumers opportunities to engage in prosocial behavior, and presenting high-status products. These findings offer guidance for retailers to leverage this new technology smartly to enhance both business performance and consumer well-being. © American Marketing Association 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161660385"

Materials and methods: A homemade large-format CMOS sensor and Gaf Chromic EBT3 films were used for the virtual source position measurement. The Gaf films were embedded in a self-designed rectangular plastic frame to tighten the films and set up on a treatment couch for irradiation in the air with the film perpendicular to the carbon ion beam at the nominal source-axis-distance (SAD) as well as upstream and downstream from the SAD. The radiation rectangular field size in horizontal and vertical directions on film or detector delivered by 5 carbon ion energies were analyzed separately in this study. The virtual source position was determined with film or detector at a distance upstream or downstream from the various source-film-distance by the half width half maximum tilting angle convergent method to compare the results conducted with the same measurement condition by the back projecting the FWHM to zero methods. Results: The determination of virtual source position by using half width half maximum tilting angle convergent method agrees with the method by back projecting the FWHM to zero, and for higher carbon ion energy has an obvious longer virtual source position since the more carbon ion beam energy, hence, the less side scatter results in the less divergent at the downstream, then the virtual source positions is distal for high energies than low energies when back projects the field sizes to zero. Conclusion: We have developed a technique capable of dealing with the virtual source position with a geometric convergent method to avoid any mistakes in the passive scatter carbon ion beam. The method for investigating the virtual source position in the carbon ion beam in this study can also be used for electrons and proton beams. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168119021"

Advances in computer information technology have contributed to the growing storage of these data in electronic form. However, the data are usually processed only locally on site. To overcome such hurdles, a cyberspace virtual reality (csVR) application was validated, in which interactive OCT data were presented simultaneously to geographically distant sites (Lucerne, London, and Barcelona) where three graders independently measured the ocular csVR OCT diameters. A total of 109 objects were measured, each three times, resulting in a total of 327 csVR measurements. A minor mean absolute difference of 5.3 µm was found among the 3 measurements of an object (standard deviation 4.2 µm, coefficient of variation 0.3% with respect to the mean object size). Despite the 5 h of online work, csVR was well tolerated and safe. Digital high-resolution OCT data can be remotely and collaboratively processed in csVR.

The virtual coach provided a consultation about treating fear of heights. Participants rated the therapeutic alliance, treatment credibility, and treatment expectancy. Both warm facial expressions (group difference = 7.44 [3.25, 11.62], p = 0.001, etap2 =0.10) and affirmative nods (group difference = 4.36 [0.21, 8.58], p = 0.040, etap2 = 0.04) by the virtual coach independently increased therapeutic alliance.

However, previous research has indicated that people often underestimate the SWSof physically equivalent to the TWS in such systems, and the underestimation varies among conditions. Thus, in this study, we focused on factors that influence (1) the difference between the SWSof and the TWS when the two speeds are perceived equivalently and (2) the minimum SWSof that can be perceptually discriminated from the TWS. The two values were obtained by the method of constant stimuli. With a constant TWS (1, 2, or 4 km/h), participants judged if the speed of presented SWSof was perceived faster than their perceived TWS, for various SWSof, in the two different types of virtual environment (with rich distance cues or with poor distance cues). The results showed that the difference between the TWS and the perceptually matched SWSof (level of underestimation) was affected by both the distance cue and TWS. The virtual environment with rich distance cues and a low TWS resulted in a larger underestimation. In addition, for the discrimination threshold, the results showed that a high TWS resulted in a larger discrimination threshold. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168754594"

These key technical researches were combined to construct an interactive bone setting technique. The virtual simulation system can reproduce the implementation process of the expert's bone setting technique. The user can observe the implementation of the manipulative technique from multiple angles; through human-computer interaction, the whole process of implementation of the bone setting technique can be simulated, and the movement and reduction of the affected bone can be observed at the same time. It can be used as a teaching and training system for assisting bone setting techniques. Students can use the system to carry out repeated self-training, and can instantly compare with the standard techniques of the expert database, breaking the traditional teaching mode of 'expected and unspeakable' and avoid directly using patients. Therefore, this research makes it possible to reduce teaching costs, reduce risks, improve teaching quality, and make up for the lack of teaching conditions.

Branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) controls the rate limiting step in BCAA degradation, the activity of which is inhibited by BCKDH kinase (BDK)-mediated phosphorylation. Screening efforts to discover BDK inhibitors led to identification of thiophene PF-07208254, which improved cardiometabolic endpoints in mice. Structure-activity relationship studies led to identification of a thiazole series of BDK inhibitors; however, these inhibitors did not improve metabolism in mice upon chronic administration. While the thiophenes demonstrated sustained branched chain ketoacid (BCKA) lowering and reduced BDK protein levels, the thiazoles increased BCKAs and BDK protein levels. Thiazoles increased BDK proximity to BCKDH-E2, whereas thiophenes reduced BDK proximity to BCKDH-E2, which may promote BDK degradation. Thus, we describe two BDK inhibitor series that possess differing attributes regarding BDK degradation or stabilization and provide a mechanistic understanding of the desirable features of an effective BDK inhibitor. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167531272"

This drawback limits the practical application of this approach to tasks such as sound field reconstruction or virtual reality. In this study, we presented a numerical approach to reduce the complexity of multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization to address the task of audio source separation for scenarios with a large number of sensors, such as high-order ambisonics encoding. In particular, we proposed a parallel driver to compute the multiplicative update rules in MNMF approaches. It is designed to function on both sequential and multicore computers, as well as graphics processing units (GPUs). The solution attempts to reduce the computational cost of multiplicative update rules by using Cholesky decomposition and solving several triangular equation systems. The driver was evaluated for different scenarios, with promising results in terms of execution times for both the CPU and GPU. To the best of our knowledge, this proposal is the first to address the problem of reducing the computational cost of full-rank MNMF-based systems using parallel and high-performance techniques. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161999891"

However, there are many unknowns regarding the effectiveness of XR technology which is limiting its adoption in sport.

Results: The results provide insight into the limitations of XR and how those limitations are likely to reduce the effectiveness of XR for training motor skills.

Novel e-health harm reduction interventions such as virtual overdose monitoring services (VOMS) have emerged in North America to improve access to emergency overdose support for people who use substances (PWUS). To date, little research has been published, and the perspectives of PWUS are needed to inform evaluation and policy efforts. Objective: To explore the beliefs, values and perceptions of PWUS around using and accessing VOMS in Canada. Methods: A qualitative study following grounded theory methodology was conducted. Using existing peer networks, purposive and snowball sampling was conducted to recruit PWUS (≥ 18 years) with previous experience with VOMS. Thematic analysis was used to analyze twenty-three interviews. Several methods were employed to enhance rigor, such as independent data coding and triangulation. Results: Twenty-three one-on-one telephone interviews of PWUS with previous experience with VOMS were completed and analyzed. The following themes emerged: (1) feelings of optimism around VOMS to save lives; (2) privacy/confidentiality was highly valued due to stigma and fear of arrest; (3) concerns with reliable cell phones negatively impacting VOMS uptake; (4) concerns around emergency response times, specifically in rural/remote communities; (5) desire for trusting relationships with VOMS operators; (6) importance of mental health supports and referrals to psychosocial services; and (7) possible limited uptake due to low public awareness of VOMS. Conclusion: This qualitative study provided novel insights about the VOMS from the perspectives of PWUS. PWUS generally felt optimistic about the potential of VOMS as a suitable harm reduction intervention, but several potential barriers around accessing VOMS were identified that may limit uptake.

Compared to other options on Earth, neutral buoyancy is relatively inexpensive and presents little danger to astronauts while simulating some aspects of microgravity. Neutral buoyancy removes somatosensory cues to the direction of gravity but leaves vestibular cues intact. Removal of both somatosensory and direction of gravity cues while floating in microgravity or using virtual reality to establish conflicts between them has been shown to affect the perception of distance traveled in response to visual motion (vection) and the perception of distance. Does removal of somatosensory cues alone by neutral buoyancy similarly impact these perceptions? During neutral buoyancy we found no significant difference in either perceived distance traveled nor perceived size relative to Earth-normal conditions. This contrasts with differences in linear vection reported between short- and long-duration microgravity and Earth-normal conditions. These results indicate that neutral buoyancy is not an effective analog for microgravity for these perceptual effects. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163118542"

Since animal welfare is a credence attribute which cannot be evaluated on the product itself, recently various labels have been introduced to help consumers make purchasing decisions according to their animal welfare concerns. However, such labels need to be accompanied by adequate information to reveal full market power. Research on how animal welfare labels should be communicated to improve efficiency is scarce. The aim of our study is therefore to investigate the impact of different information types on the understanding and evaluation, willingness to buy (WTB) and willingness to pay (WTP) for an animal-friendly product. We used a quantitative research approach with four experimental groups (n = 200). Each group (n = 50) was presented with one of four information types that differed regarding their immersive and innovative character and all provided information about the main label criteria: group 1 received text only, group 2 text and stable pictures, group 3 text and a 360° stable video via tablet, group 4 text and a 360° stable video via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Regardless of information type, participants’ understanding of the label as well as their evaluation of animal welfare and acceptability of an exemplary stable presented improved after information was given. Furthermore, providing information positively influenced the WTB and WTP. Regarding user experience, stable insights via VR glasses were particularly appreciated, even though more simpler types were considered more favourable in terms of the usage at the point of sale (POS). We conclude that various information types can be promising to communicate certain label criteria. Both higher immersive and innovative as well as more simple information types help to make animal welfare efforts more appreciated and support consumers in decision making. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164387900"

To consider gender-differences and to avoid designs that unintentionally favour only particular groups of the population, the study simulations were carried out with a male and a female 50th percentile finite element human body model (VIVA+). The risk for head, chest, femur and tibia injuries were analysed as the simulation result, since these body areas were identified based on field data to be most relevant in accidents involving pedestrians and trams. Collision scenarios are evaluated for a wide parameter variation in impact location and speed, respectively. Findings: The results show a reduction in head injury risk for both the female and the male HBM at different speeds and impact locations for impact with the enhanced version of the tram front. Depending on the gender of the HBM, the considered improvement shows different effects for each body region, with a greater reduction in the likelihood of head injury for the female model, and a greater reduction in the likelihood of thoracic injury for the male model. These differences are due to the considered anthropomorphic variations. A reduction for the risk of femur injuries can be achieved in all cases using the modified tram front. The study showcases the application of detailed human body models for tram pedestrian impact analyses in the context of pedestrian safety and in particular for tram front improvements. It was shown that even a minor modification of the tram front with softer front skirt attachments leads to remarkable benefits with respect to injury criteria in all investigated crash scenarios. The presented research goes beyond current technical recommendations and shows the benefit of virtual testing including HBMs and considering a wide variety of impact speeds, anthropometries and injury assessments, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166226173"

Public-speaking anxiety (PSA) is a prevalent form of social anxiety, characterised by stressful arousal and anxiety generated when presenting to an audience. In self-guided VRET, participants can gradually increase their tolerance to exposure and reduce anxiety-induced arousal and PSA over time. However, creating such a VR environment and determining physiological indices of anxiety-induced arousal or distress is an open challenge. Environment modelling, character creation and animation, psychological state determination and the use of machine learning (ML) models for anxiety or stress detection are equally important, and multi-disciplinary expertise is required. In this work, we have explored a series of ML models with publicly available data sets (using electroencephalogram and heart rate variability) to predict arousal states. If we can detect anxiety-induced arousal, we can trigger calming activities to allow individuals to cope with and overcome distress. Here, we discuss the means of effective selection of ML models and parameters in arousal detection. We propose a pipeline to overcome the model selection problem with different parameter settings in the context of virtual reality exposure therapy. This pipeline can be extended to other domains of interest where arousal detection is crucial. Finally, we have implemented a biofeedback framework for VRET where we successfully provided feedback as a form of heart rate and brain laterality index from our acquired multimodal data for psychological intervention to overcome anxiety. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163190450"

Traditional monitor-based gaming outputs cannot adequately represent the third dimension, whereas virtual reality headsets lack the connection to the real world. The use of Augmented Reality (AR) techniques could potentially overcome these issues. The objective of this study was thus to evaluate the usability, feasibility and functionality of a novel arm rehabilitation device for neurorehabilitation (RobExReha system) based on a robotic arm (LBR iiwa, KUKA AG) and serious gaming using the AR headset HoloLens (Microsoft Inc.). Methods: The RobExReha system was tested with eleven adult inpatients (mean age: 64.4 ± 11.2 years; diagnoses: 8 stroke, 2 spinal cord injury, 1 Guillain-Barré-Syndrome) who had paretic impairments in their upper limb. Five therapists administered and evaluated the system. Data was compared with a Reference Group (eleven inpatients; mean age: 64.3 ± 9.1 years; diagnoses: 10 stroke, 1 spinal cord injury) who trained with commercially available robotic therapy devices (ArmeoPower or ArmeoSpring, Hocoma AG). Patients used standardized questionnaires for evaluating usability and comfort (Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with assistive technology [QUEST]), workload (Raw Task Load Index [RTLX]) and a questionnaire for rating visual perception of the gaming scenario. Therapists used the QUEST, the System Usability Scale and the short version of the User Experience Questionnaire. Results: Therapy with the RobExReha system was safe and feasible for patients and therapists, with no serious adverse events being reported. Patients and therapists were generally satisfied with usability. The patients’ usability ratings were significantly higher in the Reference Group for two items of the QUEST: reliability and ease of use. Workload (RTLX) ratings did not differ significantly between the groups. Nearly all patients using the RobExReha system perceived the gaming scenario in AR as functioning adequately despite eight patients having impairments in stereoscopic vision. The therapists valued the system’s approach as interesting and inventive. Conclusions: We demonstrated the clinical feasibility of combining a novel robotic upper limb robot with an AR-serious game in a neurorehabilitation setting. To ensure high usability in future applications, a reliable and easy-to-use system that can be used for task-oriented training should be implemented.

This question comes into sharp focus as plans for interplanetary human space missions solidify. In the framework of Bayesian brain theories, gravity encapsulates a strong prior, anchoring agents to a reference frame via the vestibular system, informing their decisions and possibly their integration of uncertainty. What happens when such a strong prior is altered? We address this question using a self-motion estimation task in a space analog environment under conditions of altered gravity. Two participants were cast as remote drone operators orbiting Mars in a virtual reality environment on board a parabolic flight, where both hyper- and microgravity conditions were induced. From a first-person perspective, participants viewed a drone exiting a cave and had to first predict a collision and then provide a confidence estimate of their response. We evoked uncertainty in the task by manipulating the motion’s trajectory angle. Post-decision subjective confidence reports were negatively predicted by stimulus uncertainty, as expected. Uncertainty alone did not impact overt behavioral responses (performance, choice) differentially across gravity conditions. However microgravity predicted higher subjective confidence, especially in interaction with stimulus uncertainty. These results suggest that variables relating to uncertainty affect decision-making distinctly in microgravity, highlighting the possible need for automatized, compensatory mechanisms when considering human factors in space research. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161990529"

Whether virtual reality (VR) exergames are also appropriate and make a positive contribution to the reduction of BP has not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, the aim of the study was to gain knowledge of the load intensities to be achieved during a VR exergame and to examine the short-term effects on BP. Methods: For the preliminary study, 22 participants with hypertension over the age of 65 years were analyzed. The study took place in a mobile laboratory truck. All participants visited on two occasions. During visit 1, VR strength endurance training (VR-SET) and during visit 2, VR endurance training (VR-ET) was performed. Each VR session lasted approximately 25 min and was of a moderate intensity. Heart rate (HR) was measured across the entire session, as well as BP before and after the VR exergame. The Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and task load using NASA Task Load Index were determined after each VR session. Included in the statistical analysis were the Shapiro–Wilk test, the paired t-test, the Wilcoxon test and ANOVA for repeated measures. Results: During the “main part” (p <.001), at the “end” (p =.002) and for the “maximum HR” (p <.001), significant load differences between both VR sessions could be determined. In addition, significantly more participants in the VR-SET group achieved a moderate load intensity of at least 40% of heart rate reserve (p =.014). Regarding RPE, participants rated their subjectively perceived exertion significantly higher in the VR-SET than in the VR-ET (p =.028). Systolic BP decreased significantly in both VR sessions when compared before VR session and 5 min after VR session (p =.015; p =.003), as well as before VR session and 10 min after VR session (p =.018; p <.001). Conclusions: An individual moderate load intensity of 40% can be reached during VR-SET. In addition, a positive short-term effect of the VR exergame on BP behavior (postexercise hypotension) was observed after both VR sessions. The preliminary results indicate that a VR exergaming could lead to blood pressure lowering effects for older people with hypertension.

If it is possible to train the skills needed to work under these deviated optical angles, this could benefit procedure time and patient safety. This study investigates the influence of the optical angle on development of basic laparoscopic surgical skills. Methods: A total of 58 medical students performed a four-session laparoscopic training course on a Virtual Reality Simulator. During each session, they performed an identical task under optical angles of 0°, 45° and − 45°. Performance parameters of task duration and damage were compared between the optical angles to investigate the effect of optical angle on performance development. The 4th session performance was compared to the 2nd session performance for each angle to determine improvement. Results: Participants performed the task significantly faster under the 0° optical angle compared to the plus and minus 45° optical angles during the last three sessions (z between − 2.95 and − 2.09, p <.05). Participants improved significantly and similarly for task duration during the training course under all optical angles. At the end of the training course however significant performance differences between the zero and plus/minus 45 optical angles remained. Performance for damage did not improve and was not affected by optical angle throughout the course. Conclusion: Dedicated virtual reality training improves laparoscopic basic skills performance under deviated optical angles as it leads to shorter task duration, however a lasting performance impairment compared to the 0° optical angle remained. Training for performing under deviating optical angles can potentially shorter the learning curve in the operating room. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168986790"

The WebOfScience database was searched for neurosurgical articles published between 2012–2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020–2022 (pandemic). From this data, the keywords, terms, and countries were analyzed using networks formed by the VOS Viewer software. In addition, the analysis was repeated for neurosurgical articles specific to COVID-19. Network analyses of terms and keywords revealed an increased popularity of virtual research projects, including case reports, meta-analyses, reviews, surveys, and database studies. Additionally, there was increased interest in research pertaining to neurosurgical education during the post-pandemic era, including topics regarding virtual training modalities, mental health, and telemedicine. Our bibliometrics analysis suggests that the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on hospital systems affected neurosurgical training programs.

Towards the next generation of smart robotic manufacturing, robots must be equipped with similar capabilities to cope with grasping unknown objects in unstructured environments. However, most existing data-driven methods take global visual images and tactile readings from the real-world system as input, making them incapable of predicting the grasp outcomes for cluttered objects or generating large-scale datasets. First, this paper proposes a visual-tactile fusion method to predict the results of grasping cluttered objects, which is the most common scenario for grasping applications. Concretely, the multimodal fusion network (MMFN) uses the local point cloud within the gripper as the visual signal input, while the tactile signal input is the images provided by two high-resolution tactile sensors. Second, collecting data in the real world is high-cost and time-consuming. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twin-enabled robotic grasping system to collect large-scale multimodal datasets and investigates how to apply domain randomization and domain adaptation to bridge the sim-to-real transfer gap. Finally, extensive validation experiments are conducted in physical and virtual environments. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in assessing grasp stability for cluttered objects and performing zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer on the real robot with the aid of the proposed migration strategy. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161718394"

Yet, consumer adoption of VR technology is limited by cybersickness (CS)—a debilitating sensation accompanied by a cluster of symptoms, including nausea, oculomotor issues and dizziness. A leading problem is the lack of automated objective tools to predict or detect CS in individuals, which can then be used for resistance training, timely warning systems or clinical intervention. This paper explores the spatiotemporal brain dynamics and heart rate variability involved in cybersickness and uses this information to both predict and detect CS episodes. The present study applies deep learning of EEG in a spiking neural network (SNN) architecture to predict CS prior to using VR (85.9%, F7) and detect it (76.6%, FP1, Cz). ECG-derived sympathetic heart rate variability (HRV) parameters can be used for both prediction (74.2%) and detection (72.6%) but at a lower accuracy than EEG. Multimodal data fusion of EEG and sympathetic HRV does not change this accuracy compared to ECG alone. The study found that Cz (premotor and supplementary motor cortex) and O2 (primary visual cortex) are key hubs in functionally connected networks associated with both CS events and susceptibility to CS. F7 is also suggested as a key area involved in integrating information and implementing responses to incongruent environments that induce cybersickness. Consequently, Cz, O2 and F7 are presented here as promising targets for intervention. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165221319"

However, several commercial videogames are designed for leisure and are not oriented toward definite rehabilitation goals. Among the many, Playball® (Playwork, Alon 10, Ness Ziona, Israel) is a therapeutic ball that measures both movement and pressure applied on it while performing rehabilitation games. This study aimed: (i) to evaluate whether the use of this novel digital therapy gaming system was clinically effective during shoulder rehabilitation; (ii) to understand whether this gaming rehabilitation program was effective in improving patients’ engagement (perceived enjoyment and self-efficacy during therapy; attitude and intention to train at home) in comparison to a control non-gaming rehabilitation program. Methods: A randomized controlled experimental design was outlined. Twenty-two adults with shoulder pathologies were recruited for a rehabilitation program of ten consecutive sessions. A control (CTRL; N = 11; age: 62.0 ± 10.9 yrs) and an intervention group (PG; N = 11; age: 59.9 ± 10.2 yrs) followed a non-digital and a digital therapy, respectively. The day before (T0) and after (T1) the rehabilitation program, pain, strength, and mobility assessments were performed, together with six questionnaires: PENN shoulder Score, PACES-short, Self-efficacy, Attitudes to train at home, Intention to train at home, and System usability scale (SUS). Results: MANOVA analysis showed significant improvements in pain (p < 0.01), strength (p < 0.05), and PENN Shoulder Score (p < 0.001) in both groups. Similarly, patients’ engagement improved, with significant increments in Self-efficacy (p < 0.05) and attitude (p < 0.05) scores in both groups after the rehabilitation. Pearson correlation showed significant correlations of the Δ scores (T1 - T0) between PACES and Self-efficacy (r = 0.623; p = 0.041) and between PACES and Intention to train at home (r = 0.674; p = 0.023) only in the PG. SUS score after the rehabilitation (74.54 ± 15.60) overcame the cut-off value of 68, representative of good usability of a device. Conclusions: The investigated digital therapy resulted as effective as an equivalent non-digital therapy in shoulder rehabilitation. The reported positive relationship between the subject’s enjoyment during digital therapy and intention to train at home suggests promising results in possible patient’s exercise engagement at home after the rehabilitation in the medical center.

This new backbone plays a vital role in dealing with the outbreak of traffic patterns generated by diverse services. Elastic optical networks (EONs) can be used for maximum flexibility to interconnect the computing infrastructure and data centers (DCs) required to host these VNFs and effectively transport the heterogeneous traffic flowing through the VNF-SC. The aim of the paper is to provide a complete mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for the problem of VNF-SC deployment with survivability to minimize the total number of functions, balance the load utilization through grooming, and avoid spectrum fragmentation in EONs. In addition, we propose an efficient heuristic solution in dealing with the problem of large networks. The performance of the proposed strategies is evaluated based on the availability of resources (function computing capability).

Bidirectional modulation of somatostatin cell mTORC1 activity, a crucial translational control mechanism in synaptic plasticity, causes parallel changes in hippocampal CA1 somatostatin interneuron (SOM-IN) long-term potentiation and hippocampus-dependent memory, indicating a key role in learning. However, SOM-IN activity changes and behavioral correlates during learning, and the role of mTORC1 in these processes, remain ill-defined. To address these questions, we used two-photon Ca2+ imaging from SOM-INs during a virtual reality goal-directed spatial memory task in head-fixed control mice (SOM-IRES-Cre mice) or in mice with conditional knockout of Rptor (SOM-Rptor-KO mice) to block mTORC1 activity in SOM-INs. We found that control mice learn the task, but SOM-Raptor-KO mice exhibit a deficit. Also, SOM-IN Ca2+ activity became increasingly related to reward during learning in control mice but not in SOM-Rptor-KO mice. Four types of SOM-IN activity patterns related to reward location were observed, “reward off sustained”, “reward off transient”, “reward on sustained” and “reward on transient”, and these responses showed reorganization after reward relocation in control but not SOM-Rptor-KO mice. Thus, SOM-INs develop mTORC1-dependent reward- related activity during learning. This coding may bi-directionally interact with pyramidal cells and other structures to represent and consolidate reward location. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163963558"

The present paper proposes a methodology to find localized micro-events from the social network stream. The method is named CommunityINDICATOR. A concept of ‘separation of concerns’ from the software design principle is incorporated in the methodology to reduce the execution time drastically from existing state-of-the-art methods of event detection. In order to reduce the execution time, the algorithm first generates an interaction graph from the social stream and applies community detection followed by a clustering algorithm onto it to detect micro-level events. Experiments have been conducted on Twitter data stream of 5 different cities on three different continents with the size of 2 million tweets. We have used well known quality metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and execution time to compare performance with other state-of-the-art methodologies. The proposed CommunityINDICATOR provides up to 30% higher accuracy than EvenTweet and SEDTWik in similar execution times. An improvement of 11% to 51% and 17% to 57% in execution time is observed for the proposed algorithm in comparison with TwiiterNews and EventX, respectively, for different datasets. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164274577"

Virtual reality (VR) is one of the emerging technologies with the potential to improve health professionals’ education. Highly realistic learning experiences with repeatable training scenarios can be created within a protected environment that is independent from real patients' presence. Our project “medical tr.AI.ning” is following this approach aiming to simulate immersive virtual first-person scenarios with intelligent, interactable virtual patients. So far, VR has been mainly used in surgical training, but there is evidence for effectiveness in training different procedural skills, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, knowledge acquisition, and improvement of reasoning and creativity, while still being cost-effective. The objective of this scoping review is to explore the usage and identify key areas of VR applications in the field of medical education. Furthermore, the corresponding requirements, evaluation methods and outcomes, advantages, and disadvantages will be covered. Methods: This scoping review protocol implements the updated JBI Scoping Review Methodology. In March 2022, a preliminary literature research in PubMed was performed by two independent reviewers to refine search terms and strategy as well as inclusion criteria of the protocol, accounting for actuality and scientific relevance. The final search will be conducted using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection, and JBI Evidence Synthesis. Search, study screening, and data extraction will be done in parallel and independently by two reviewers. Discrepancies will be handled by consensus or consulting a third review author. Discussion: With this scoping review, we anticipate collating the range of application of VR in medical education while using a transparent and reproducible search strategy. This may contribute to the design and development of novel educational VR platforms and their integration into medical curricula while pointing out previous omissions and pitfalls. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162658951"

The first month of post-stroke rehabilitation is the most effective period for recovery. Movement imagination, known as motor imagery, in combination with virtual reality may provide a way for stroke patients with severe motor disabilities to begin rehabilitation. Methods: The aim of this study is to verify whether motor imagery and virtual reality help to activate stroke patients’ motor cortex. 16 acute/subacute (< 6 months) stroke patients participated in this study. All participants performed motor imagery of basketball shooting which involved the following tasks: listening to audio instruction only, watching a basketball shooting animation in 3D with audio, and also performing motor imagery afterwards. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded for analysis of motor-related features of the brain such as power spectral analysis in the α and β frequency bands and spectral entropy. 18 EEG channels over the motor cortex were used for all stroke patients. Results: All results are normalised relative to all tasks for each participant. The power spectral densities peak near the α band for all participants and also the β band for some participants. Tasks with instructions during motor imagery generally show greater power spectral peaks. The p-values of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for band power comparison from the 18 EEG channels between different pairs of tasks show a 0.01 significance of rejecting the band powers being the same for most tasks done by stroke subjects. The motor cortex of most stroke patients is more active when virtual reality is involved during motor imagery as indicated by their respective scalp maps of band power and spectral entropy. Conclusion: The resulting activation of stroke patient’s motor cortices in this study reveals evidence that it is induced by imagination of movement and virtual reality supports motor imagery. The framework of the current study also provides an efficient way to investigate motor imagery and virtual reality during post-stroke rehabilitation. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163979340"

By adjusting the driving voltages on the liquid lenses, the adaptive micro-projection system can work with the distance at least from 150 mm to 310 mm continuously. Moreover, by synchronously controlling the refresh of the LCoS and the sequential lighting of the three-color light source through the display driver board, a 60 Hz color video display can be realized with only one piece of LCoS. We introduce the design method of the liquid lens based zoom projection lens in detail and provide an optical structure of the liquid lens based zoom projection lens with excellent performance. The control software and hardware of the system are carefully developed. Simulations and experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the system.

Thus, the preconditions and challenges of use must be investigated from teachers’ perspectives prior to implementing these technologies in Saudi schools and higher educational institutes. Therefore, this study examines the feasibility of applying XR tools and platforms in the classroom by understanding teachers’ opinions, especially regarding creating or acquiring XR educational content. A qualitative study is conducted using semi-structured interviews with ten educators in Saudi Arabia. As a result, several themes are identified: (1) an XR level of awareness among teachers, (2) an XR-learning content-acquiring approach, (3) teachers’ readiness for XR, (4) students’ readiness for XR, and (5) XR challenges for schools, including social aspects that are often overlooked. These themes highlight teachers’ interest in immersive technologies with their concerns about their possible use in the classroom. Hence, the study provides greater insights for exploration and application for future studies in this area.

Reference lists of the identified articles were hand-searched for additional relevant articles to be included in this review. Results: Different types of simulators have been used for VATS training: synthetic lung models (dry simulators); live animals or animal tissues (wet simulators); and simulators based on virtual or augmented reality. Their role in surgical training has been generally defined as useful. However, not enough data are available to ascertain which type is the most appropriate. Conclusions: Simulator application in the field of medical education could revolutionize the regular surgical training curriculum. Further studies are required to better define their impact on surgeons’ training programs and, finally, on patients’ quality of care. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165883398"

The current paradigm of teaching manual therapy incorporates the traditional ‘See one, do one, teach one’ approach. However, this ‘teacher centred’ approach may not enable learners to develop the complex clinical skills of manual therapy. In this context, 3D technologies such as virtual reality may facilitate the teaching and learning of manual therapy. Hence the aim of the current study was to investigate the perception, knowledge and attitude of manual therapy learners about the use of 3D technologies in manual therapy education. Methods: An exploratory qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews was used in this study. A total of ten manual therapy (5 physiotherapy and 5 osteopathic) students (mean age = 32; 80% female) enrolled in an appropriate physiotherapy or osteopathic degree provided by a New Zealand recognized institution (e.g., university or polytechnic) participated in this study. Data saturation was achieved after 10 interviews (average duration: 35 min) that provided thick data. A thematic analysis was used for data analysis. Results: Six factors were identified which appeared to influence participants’ perception of role of technology in manual therapy education. These were (1) the sufficiency of current teaching method; (2) evolution as a learner (a novice to an expert); (3) need for objectivity; (4) tutor feedback; (5) knowledge and (6) barriers and enablers. These six factors influenced the participants’ perception about the role of 3D technologies in manual therapy education with participants evidently taking two distinct/polarized positions (‘no role’ (techstatic) versus a ‘complete role’ (techsavvy)). Conclusion: Although 3D technology may not replace face-to-face teaching, it may be used to complement the traditional approach of learning/teaching to facilitate the learning of complex skills according to the perceptions of manual therapy learners in our study. The advantage of such an approach is an area of future research. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165088415"

A possible solution to these discrepancies is that 3D perception is in fact comprised of two different processes—perception of traveled space, and perception of surrounding space. Here we tested these two aspects on the same subjects, for the first time. To differentiate these two aspects and investigate whether they emerge from different processes, we asked whether these two aspects are affected differently by the individual's experience of 3D locomotion. Using an immersive high-grade flight-simulator with realistic virtual-reality, we compared these two aspects of 3D perception in fighter pilots—individuals highly experienced in 3D locomotion—and in control subjects. We found that the two aspects of 3D perception were affected differently by 3D locomotion experience: the perception of 3D traveled space was plastic and experience-dependent, differing dramatically between pilots and controls, while the perception of surrounding space was rigid and unaffected by experience. This dissociation suggests that these two aspects of 3D spatial perception emerge from two distinct processes. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164542412"

One of the essential advantages of transforming tests in an immersive virtual environment is the possibility of automatically calculating the test’s score, a time-consuming process under natural conditions. Although the characteristics of VR can deliver different degrees of immersion in a virtual environment, the sense of presence could jeopardize the evolution of these practices. The sense of presence results from a complex interaction between human, contextual factors, and the VR environment. The present study has two aims: firstly, it contributes to the validation of a virtual version of the naturalistic action test (i.e., virtual reality action test); second, it aims to evaluate the role of sense of presence as a critical booster of the expression of cognitive abilities during virtual reality tasks. The study relies on healthy adults tested in virtual and real conditions in a cross-over research design. The study’s results support the validity of the virtual reality action test. Furthermore, two structural equation models are tested to comprehend the role of sense of presence as a moderator in the relationship between cognitive abilities and virtual task performance. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168282544"

This scoping review aimed to examine the technologies used in asynchronous e-learning for the continuing education of clinical nurses and their modes of delivery and effectiveness. Methods: This scoping review covered the period between 2011 and 2023. Six databases were searched for relevant studies following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) protocol. Results: Sixty articles met the inclusion criteria. There was a noticeable trend toward using diverse technology-enabled and enhanced training (TEET) options after 2017. The enabling technological approaches, such as interactive online modules (25 articles) and video modules (25 articles), are described in the articles. The most commonly used enhancing technologies were scenario-based learning (nine articles), resource access (eight articles), computer simulation or virtual reality (three articles), and gamification (three articles). Among the outcomes, knowledge acquisition was the most commonly examined outcome (41 articles). Conclusions: Notably, many interactive TEET modules were used in asynchronous e-learning. There were few studies on gamification, computer simulation or virtual reality, and scenario-based learning (techniques to enhance intrinsic motivation further). However, the adoption of asynchronous e-learning with advanced TEET options is anticipated to increase in the future. Therefore, objective outcome measures are required to determine the effects of such learning methods on knowledge acquisition and behavioral changes. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164845922"

Methods: Twenty-nine participants dependent on methamphetamine (METH) and 30 healthy participants were instructed to experience a METH-related virtual reality (VR) social environment. Results: Individuals with METH dependence showed significantly stronger self-reported craving and higher gamma power in a VR environment than healthy individuals. In the METH group, the VR environment elicited a significant increase in gamma power compared with the resting state. The METH group then received a VR counterconditioning procedure (VRCP), which was deemed useful in suppressing cue-induced reactivity. After VRCP, participants showed significantly lower self-reported craving scores and gamma power when exposed to drug-related cues than the first time.

Performing technical skills competently involves the use of cognitive and motor function. The training of these technical skills is typically carried out in clinical simulation laboratories. Peripheral intravenous catheter/cannula insertion is an example of a technical skill. It is the most common invasive procedure performed in the healthcare environment. Owing to unacceptable clinical risk and complications to patients, it is imperative that practitioners performing these skills are trained effectively to provide patients with best practice and high-quality care. Technologies identified as innovative teaching methods to help train students in this skill and in the skill of venepuncture include virtual reality, hypermedia and simulators. However, little high-quality evidence exists to confirm such educational approaches are effective. Methods/design: This study is a single-centre, non-blinded, two-group, pre-test and post-test randomised control trial. The randomised control trial will investigate whether a formal structured self-evaluation of videoed performance (experimental group) has an impact on nursing students’ peripheral intravenous cannulation knowledge, performance and confidence. The control group will also be videoed performing the skill but they will not view or self-evaluate their videoed performance. The peripheral intravenous cannulation procedures will be carried out in a clinical simulation laboratory using a task trainer. The data collection tools will be completed online using survey forms. Students will be randomised into the experimental group or into the control group using simple random sampling. The primary outcome measures the nursing students’ knowledge level of the skill of peripheral intravenous cannulation insertion. Secondary outcomes evaluate procedural competence and self-reported confidence and practices in the clinical environment. Discussion: This randomised control trial will investigate whether this pedagogical approach, using video modelling and self-evaluation, will positively influence students’ knowledge, confidence and performance in the skill of peripheral intravenous cannulation. Evaluating such teaching strategies using stringent methodologies may be impactful in influencing the training provided to healthcare practitioners. Trial registration: The randomised control trial detailed in this article is an educational research study and so does not fall under the ICMJE definition of a clinical trial as “any research project that prospectively assigns people or a group of people to an intervention, with or without concurrent comparison or control groups, to study the relationship between a health-related intervention and a health outcome”. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149983540"

However, no previous study investigated the moderating role of cognitive reappraisal in the relationship between exposure to different types of natural environments (a national park, a lacustrine environment, and an arctic environment vs. an urban environment) and subjective vitality. We designed a between-subject design (four conditions, one per type of environment) with a sample of 187 university students (Mage = 21.17, SD = 2.55). Participants were exposed to four 360° panoramic photos of the environment for one minute each with a virtual reality head-mounted display. The results of a multicategorical moderation analysis attested that there were two significant interactions, respectively between lacustrine and arctic environments and cognitive reappraisal. More specifically, for participants with low levels of habitual use of cognitive reappraisal, the effects of virtual nature (vs. urban) exposure on subjective vitality were not significant, while for participants with high levels, the effects were significant and positive. Findings show how the potential of virtual nature may be boosted with training aimed at increasing the general use of cognitive reappraisal, supports enhancing the applications of virtual nature, and demonstrates the need to take individual differences into account when determining the benefits of these applications. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151108939"

While some systems have shown moderate success, it is unclear how well the complex motor skills learned in an AR simulation transfer to completing the same tasks in physical reality. Limb loading is a possible dimension of motor skill execution that is absent in current AR solutions that may help to increase skill transfer between the virtual and physical domains. Methods: We implemented an immersive AR environment where individuals could operate a myoelectric virtual prosthesis to accomplish a variety of object relocation manipulations. Intact limb participants were separated into three groups, the load control (CGLD; N= 4), the AR control (CGAR; N= 4), and the experimental group (EG; N= 4). Both the CGAR and EG completed a 5-session prosthesis training protocol in AR while the CGLD performed simple muscle training. The EG attempted manipulations in AR while undergoing limb loading. The CGAR attempted the same manipulations without loading. All participants performed the same manipulations in physical reality while operating a real prosthesis pre- and post-training. The main outcome measure was the change in the number of manipulations completed during the physical reality assessments (i.e. completion rate). Secondary outcomes included movement kinematics and visuomotor behavior. Results: The EG experienced a greater increase in completion rate post-training than both the CGAR and CGLD. This performance increase was accompanied by a shorter motor learning phase, the EG’s performance saturating in less sessions of AR training than the CGAR. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that limb loading plays an important role in transferring complex motor skills learned in virtual spaces to their physical reality analogs. While participants who did not receive limb loading were able to receive some functional benefit from AR training, participants who received the loading experienced a greater positive change in motor performance with their performance saturating in fewer training sessions. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146947299"

However, their inherently static geometry is an obstacle to many applications where dynamic tunability in their optical behaviour is required. Currently, there is a quest to enable dynamic tuning of metasurface properties, particularly with fast tuning rate, large modulation by small electrical signals, solid state and programmable across multiple pixels. Here, we demonstrate electrically tunable metasurfaces driven by thermo-optic effect and flash-heating in silicon. We show a 9-fold change in transmission by <5 V biasing voltage and the modulation rise-time of <625 µs. Our device consists of a silicon hole array metasurface encapsulated by transparent conducting oxide as a localised heater. It allows for video frame rate optical switching over multiple pixels that can be electrically programmed. Some of the advantages of the proposed tuning method compared with other methods are the possibility to apply it for modulation in the visible and near-infrared region, large modulation depth, working at transmission regime, exhibiting low optical loss, low input voltage requirement, and operating with higher than video-rate switching speed. The device is furthermore compatible with modern electronic display technologies and could be ideal for personal electronic devices such as flat displays, virtual reality holography and light detection and ranging, where fast, solid-state and transparent optical switches are required. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148700256"

Neurosurgeons have to spend plenty of time mastering the nuances of the autopsy. However, the laboratory that can meet the requirements of neurosurgery microanatomy is only owned by several large medical colleges because it is an expensive affair. Thus, laboratories worldwide are searching for substitutes,but the reality and local details might not meet the exact requirements of the anatomical structure. Herein, we compared the traditional teaching mode, the 3D image generated by the current advanced hand-held scanner and our self-developed 2D image fitting 3D imaging method in the comparative study of neuroanatomy education. Methods: To examine the efficacy of two-dimensional fitting three-dimensional imaging techniques in neuroanatomy education. 60 clinical students of grade 2020 in Wannan Medical College were randomly divided into traditional teaching group, hand held scanner 3D imaging group and 2D fitting 3D method group, with 20 students in each group.First, the modeling images of the hand held scanner 3D imaging group and the 2D fitting 3D method group are analyzed and compared, and then the teaching results of the three groups are evaluated by objective and subjective evaluation methods. The objective evaluation is in the form of examination papers, unified proposition and unified score; The subjective evaluation is conducted in the form of questionnaires to evaluate. Results: The modeling and image analysis of the current advanced hand-held 3D imaging scanner and our self-developed 2D fitting 3D imaging method were compared.The images (equivalent to 1, 10, and 40 × magnification) of the model points and polygons using the Cinema 4D R19 virtual camera of 50, 500, and 2000 mm showed 1,249,955 points and 2,500,122 polygons in the skull data obtained using the hand-held scanner. The 3D model data of the skull consisted of 499,914 points, while the number of polygons reached up to 60,000,000, which was about fourfold that of the hand-held 3D scanning. This model used 8 K mapping technology, and hand-held scanner 3D imaging 3D scanning modeling used a 0.13 K map based on the map data, thereby indicating that the 2D fitting 3D imaging method is delicate and real. Comparative analysis of general data of three groups of students.The comparison of test results, clinical practice assessment and teaching satisfaction of the three groups shows that the performance of hand held scanner 3D imaging group is better than that of traditional teaching group (P < 0.01), and that of 2D fitting 3D method group is significantly better than that of traditional teaching group (P < 0.01). Conclusions: The method used in this study can achieve real reduction. Compared to hand-held scanning, this method is more cost-effective than the cost of the equipment and the results. Moreover, the post-processing is easy to master, and the autopsy can be performed easily after learning, negating the need to seek professional help. It has a wide application prospect in teaching. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159205569"

Similarly, virtual reality (VR) simulators have demonstrated their effectiveness in fostering surgical skill acquisition and provide a promising, realistic environment for spaced training. To explore how spacing impacts VR simulator-based acquisition of surgical psychomotor skills, we performed a systematic literature review. Methods: We systematically searched the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, ERIC and CINAHL for studies investigating the influence of spacing on the effectiveness of VR simulator training focused on psychomotor skill acquisition in healthcare professionals. We assessed the quality of all included studies using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) and the risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias assessment tool. We extracted and aggregated qualitative data regarding spacing interval, psychomotor task performance and several other performance metrics. Results: The searches yielded 1662 unique publications. After screening the titles and abstracts, 53 publications were retained for full text screening and 7 met the inclusion criteria. Spaced training resulted in better performance scores and faster skill acquisition when compared to control groups with a single day (massed) training session. Spacing across consecutive days seemed more effective than shorter or longer spacing intervals. However, the included studies were too heterogeneous in terms of spacing interval, obtained performance metrics and psychomotor skills analysed to allow for a meta-analysis to substantiate our outcomes. Conclusion: Spacing in VR simulator-based surgical training improved skill acquisition when compared to massed training. The overall number and quality of available studies were only moderate, limiting the validity and generalizability of our findings. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150208978"

This technology is increasingly used in the training of healthcare professionals, and previous studies show that the involvement and motivation of students who participate in activities that use VR increases compared to those who undergo training with the traditional methodology. The main aim of the study is to evaluate the learning curve of the students using a VR environment, to evaluate the satisfaction with the training activity and the cost, and to compare them with training that uses role-playing methodology. Methodology: Two-arm community-based randomised trial. The control arm will base the training on the usual role-playing methodology. The second arm or intervention arm will base the Basic Life Support (BLS) training on a VR programme. Results: Statistically significant differences are observed in the percentage of correct answers in favour of the group that used VR as a learning methodology in the test taken at the end of the course. These differences disappear when comparing the results of the test performed at six months. The satisfaction rating of the role-playing training activity has a score of 9.37 out of a total of 10 and satisfaction with the VR methodology has a score of 9.72. The cost analysis shows that the cost of training a student by role-playing is 32.5 euros and, if trained by VR, it is 41.6 euros. Conclusions: VR is a tool that allows the consolidation of a greater amount of knowledge in the short term and can be used for situations such as pandemics, where traditional formats are not available. In relation to student satisfaction with the training activity, the rating in both groups is very high and the differences are minimal. The results will be directly applicable to the decision making of BLS training in Central Catalonia in relation to the scheduling of training activities that use the VR methodology in an uncertain environment. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146765266"

Unfortunately, it is not often clear in advance which environmental and urban design implementations will generate increases in activities such as walking, and which will have little impact or even reduce walking. The present study tested the feasibility and acceptability of a virtual reality (VR) model for pre-testing urban designs for their impact on walking. Using a wearable VR head-mounted display/computer, young adults (n = 40) walked freely through a large indoor gymnasium, simultaneously walking through a virtual model of an urban streetscape that was designed to be modifiable and allow for testing impacts on walking of various changes to the urban environment. The majority of participants found the experience to be acceptable: pleasant and nonaversive, and they walked freely through the VR model for approximately 20 min, on average. Using modifiable VR models to pre-test built-environment changes for their impacts on walking behavior appears to be a feasible and acceptable approach and worthy of continued research investigation. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152262274"

Many schools are resorting to a virtual field trip (VFT), especially when education is disrupted due to public health concerns, natural disasters, or other unforeseen significant events. Virtual reality as a common form of VFT is likely not an option for many schools due to cost and other barriers. The purpose of our study was to explore the potential of going in a VFT using 360-degree (360°) videos as an alternative to a physical field trip in primary education. We recruited third-grade pupils (aged 8–9) from two private elementary schools to experience VFTs using 360° videos (360V) and regular videos (REGV). Using a switching-replications experimental design, we compared their content recall (assessment tests) and VFT experience (attitude, perceived usefulness, involvement, inquiry, video engagement, and virtual guide) across four-time points. Our results show that the increase in content recall scores of 360V groups after VFTs was consistently higher compared to REGV groups at all time points, although it was only significant in one quarter. We also found pupils’ video engagement, involvement, and attitude as significant factors in their VFT experience. These results call attention to a possible implementation of VFTs and continue the long-standing tradition that has been acknowledged as a student-centered, interactive instructional method. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146763242"

Chile enacted relatively stringent laws that restrict unhealthy food marketing to children in two phases, beginning in 2016. Dillman-Carpentier and colleagues examined the incremental effectiveness of the first and second phases of Chile’s policy in limiting children’s exposure to unhealthy food marketing on television relative to pre-policy. Banning advertisements for all ‘high-in’ products (i.e., those that exceeded thresholds for energy, saturated fats, sugars and/or sodium) during the daytime (phase 2) was more effective in reducing children’s exposure to unhealthy food marketing on television than only banning ‘high-in’ marketing during programs with large child audiences (phase 1). These findings underscore the importance of implementing comprehensive policies that reduce children’s exposure to all marketing for unhealthy foods—not simply that which targets them directly—to better protect them from its negative impacts. However, although policies in Chile and other nations have reduced children’s exposure to unhealthy food marketing in broadcast media, it is not clear whether such policies have meaningfully reduced children’s overall food marketing exposures. This is partly due to the challenges of studying children’s digital food marketing exposures, which are an increasingly important source of unhealthy food marketing. To address these methodologic gaps, several research teams are developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled systems to assess food marketing to children on digital media and support efforts to monitor compliance with policies that restrict this marketing. These and other AI systems will be essential to comprehensively and systematically study and monitor food marketing to children on digital media internationally and at scale. © 2023, The Author(s).","Note","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160252964"

The mechanisms underlying the pre-exposure effect in humans, however, are poorly understood. Moreover, pain sensitivity has been linked to dental fear conditioning in correlational investigations and theory suggests it may moderate the latent inhibition effect, but this hypothesis has not been directly tested. These gaps in our understanding are a barrier to the development of evidence-based dental phobia prevention efforts. Methods: Healthy volunteers between the ages of 6 and 35 years will be enrolled across two sites. Participants will complete a conditioning task in a novel virtual reality environment, allowing for control over pre-exposure and the examination of behaviour. A dental startle (a brief, pressurized puff of air to a tooth) will serve as the unconditioned stimulus. Using a within-subjects experimental design, participants will experience a pre-exposed to-be conditioned stimulus, a non-pre-exposed to-be conditioned stimulus, and a neutral control stimulus. Two hypothesized mechanisms, changes in prediction errors and attention, are expected to mediate the association between stimulus condition and fear acquisition, recall, and retention. To ascertain the involvement of pain sensitivity, this construct will be measured through self-report and the cold pressor task. Discussion: Dental phobia negatively affects the dental health and overall health of individuals. This study aims to determine the mechanisms through which pre-exposure retards conditioned dental fear acquisition, recall, and retention. A randomized control trial will be used to identify these mechanisms so that they can be precisely targeted and maximally engaged in preventative efforts. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146878863"

Articles were sourced from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases using subject headings and keywords related to “social participation” and “digital technology”. Studies that adopted digital technology interventions to improve social participation in adults with long-term physical conditions were included. Data on study methodology, participant and digital intervention characteristics, and findings related to social participation were extracted. The search yielded a total of 4646 articles and 14 articles met criteria for final review with five randomized controlled trials, two non-randomized clinical trials and seven one-group pretest–posttest clinical trials. Studies were organized based on the digital intervention strategy implemented to improve social participation: group support (n = 4), individual skill training or counseling (n = 6), education and support (n = 3), and mixed intervention (n = 1). The group support interventions developed a social network among participants through videoconference, app, or virtual reality platform. Three studies reported positive improvements in different aspects of social participation. Individual skill training or counseling mainly utilized phone calls to help participants cope with activity participation and interpersonal relationship issues. Only two studies demonstrated benefits for social participation. The education and support intervention, which used messages and website information to increase participants’ knowledge and provide support, showed positive findings in three studies. This review suggests digital interventions for improving social participation in adults with long-term physical conditions are feasible and the effectiveness of different strategies may vary.

The rise in substance use and related harms, including overdose, during the Covid-19 pandemic has created a critical need for more innovative and accessible substance use interventions. Digital interventions have shown effectiveness and can provide more engaging, less stigmatizing, and accessible interventions that meet the needs of young people. This review provides an overview of recent literature on the nature of recently published digital interventions for young people in terms of technologies used, substances targeted, intended outcomes and theoretical or therapeutic models employed. Methods: Rapid review methodology was used to identify and assess the literature on digital interventions for young people. An initial keyword search was conducted using MEDLINE the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) and PROSPERO for the years 2015–2020, and later updated to December 2021. Following a title/abstract and full-text screening of articles, and consensus decision on study inclusion, the data extraction process proceeded using an extraction grid developed for the study. Data synthesis relied on an adapted conceptual framework by Stockings, et al. that involved a three-level treatment spectrum for youth substance use (prevention, early intervention, and treatment) for any type of substance. Results: In total, the review identified 43 articles describing 39 different digital interventions. Most were early interventions (n = 28), followed by prevention interventions (n = 6) and treatment interventions (n = 5). The identified digital technologies included web-based (n = 14), game-based (n = 10), mobile-based (n = 7), and computer-based (n = 5) technologies, and virtual reality (n = 3). Most interventions targeted alcohol use (n = 20) followed by tobacco/nicotine (n = 5), cannabis (n = 2), opioids (n = 2), ketamine (1) and multiple, or any substances (n = 9). Most interventions used a personalized or normative feedback approach and aimed to effect behaviour change as the intended outcome. Interestingly, a harm reduction approach guided only one of the 39 interventions. Conclusions: While web-based interventions represented the most common type of technology, more recently developed immersive and interactive technologies such as virtual reality and game-based interventions call for further exploration. Digital interventions focused mainly on alcohol use, reflecting less concern for tobacco, cannabis, co-occurring substance use, and illicit drug use. Specifically, the recent exacerbation in the opioid crisis throughout North American underlines the urgent need for more prevention-oriented digital interventions for opioid use. The uptake of digital interventions among youth also depends on the incorporation of harm reduction approaches. © 2023, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148342825"

Virtual reality provides simulated experiences of being in nature when outdoor access is limited. Previous studies on virtual nature have focused mainly on single ""doses"" of virtual nature. The effects of repeated exposure remain poorly understood. Motivated by this gap, we studied the influence of a daily virtual nature intervention on symptoms of anxiety, depression, and an underlying cause of poor mental health: rumination. Forty college students (58% non-Hispanic White, median age = 19) were recruited from two U.S. universities and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Over several weeks, anxious arousal (panic) and anxious apprehension (worry) decreased with virtual nature exposure. Participants identifying as women, past VR users, experienced with the outdoors, and engaged with the beauty in nature benefited particularly strongly from virtual nature. Virtual nature did not help symptoms of anhedonic depression or rumination. Further research is necessary to distinguish when and for whom virtual nature interventions impact mental health outcomes. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146774011"

Robotic assembly technology in automatic production lines has greatly improved the production efficiency. However, in assembly process, dynamic disturbances such as processing time change and advance delivery may occur, which cause the scheduling deviation. Traditional scheduling methods are not sufficient to meet the real-time and adaptive requirements in smart manufacturing. Digital twin (DT) has the characteristics of virtual-reality interaction and real-time mapping. In this paper, we propose a DT-based framework of task rescheduling for robotic assembly line (RAL) and its key methodologies, thus to realize the timely and dynamic adjustment of scheduling plan under uncertain interferences. First, a DT model of RAL task rescheduling composed of physical entity (PE), virtual entity (VE), and virtual-reality interaction mechanism is proposed. Then, a mathematical model is established. By analyzing the adaptive objective thresholds from the perspectives of event trigger and user demand trigger, a DT-driven multi-level (production unit level and line level) rescheduling strategy is proposed. Taking both the computing time and solution quality into consideration, the precedence graph is introduced to propose a rescheduling approach based on an improved discrete fireworks algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model and approach are verified by task scheduling experiments of RAL. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147105423"

Bystanders at the scene can perform first aid measures before the arrival of health services. The quality of first aid measures likely affects patient outcome. However, scientific evidence on its effect on patient outcome is limited. To properly assess bystander first aid quality, measure effect, and facilitate improvement, validated assessment tools are needed. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a First Aid Quality Assessment (FAQA) tool. The FAQA tool focuses on first aid measures for injured patients based on the ABC-principle, as assessed by ambulance personnel arriving on scene. Methods: In phase 1, we drafted an initial version of the FAQA tool for assessment of airway management, control of external bleeding, recovery position and hypothermia prevention. A group of ambulance personnel aided presentation and wording of the tool. In phase 2 we made eight virtual reality (VR) films, each presenting an injury scenario where bystander performed first aid. In phase 3, an expert group discussed until consensus on how the FAQA tool should rate each scenario. Followingly, 19 respondents, all ambulance personnel, rated the eight films with the FAQA tool. We assessed concurrent validity and inter-rater agreement by visual inspection and Kendall’s coefficient of concordance. Results: FAQA-scores by the expert group concurred with ± 1 of the median of the respondents on all first aid measures for all eight films except one case, where a deviation of 2 was seen. The inter-rater agreement was “very good” for three first aid measures, “good” for one, and “moderate” for the scoring of overall quality on first aid measures. Conclusion: Our findings show that it is feasible and acceptable for ambulance personnel to collect information on bystander first aid with the FAQA tool and will be of importance for future research on bystander first aid for injured patients. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151673418"

Conventional teaching, however, may not adequately equip trainees with an understanding of complex visuospatial relationships of the middle ear. Both face and content validation were assessed of a novel three-dimensional (3D) photorealistic virtual ear simulation tool underwent face and content validation as an educational tool for OHNS trainees. Methods: A three-dimensional mesh reconstruction of open access imaging was generated using geometric modeling, which underwent global illumination, subsurface scattering, and texturing to create photorealistic virtual reality (VR) ear models were created from open access imaging and comiled into a educational platform. This was compiled into an educational VR platform which was explored to validate the face and content validity questionnaires in a prospective manner. OHNS post-graduate trainees were recruited from University of Toronto and University of Calgary OHNS programs. Participation was on a voluntary basis. Results: Total of 23 OHNS post-graduate trainees from the two universities were included in this study. The mean comfort level of otologic anatomy was rated 4.8 (± 2.2) out of 10. Senior residents possessed more otologic surgical experience (P < 0.001) and higher average comfort when compared to junior residents [6.7 (± 0.7) vs. 3.6 (± 1.9); P = 0.001]. Face and content validities were achieved in all respective domains with no significant difference between the two groups. Overall, respondents believed OtoVIS was a useful tool to learn otologic anatomy with a median score of 10.0 (8.3–10.0) and strongly agreed that OtoVIS should be added to OHNS training with a score of 10.0 (9.3–10.0). Conclusions: OtoVIS achieved both face and content validity as a photorealistic VR otologic simulator for teaching otologic anatomy in the postgraduate setting. As an immersive learning tool, it may supplement trainees’ understanding and residents endorsed its use.

In current clinical practice, the assessment of neglect is based on old-fashioned paper-and-pencil and behavioral tasks, and sometimes relies on the examiner’s subjective judgment. Therefore, there is a need for more exhaustive, objective and ecological assessments of USN. Methods: In this paper, we present two tasks in immersive virtual reality to assess peripersonal and extrapersonal USN. The tasks are designed with several levels of difficulty to increase sensitivity of the assessment. We then validate the feasibility of both assessments in a group of healthy adult participants. Results: We report data from a study with a group of neurologically unimpaired participants (N = 39). The results yield positive feedback on comfort, usability and design of the tasks. We propose new objective scores based on participant’s performance captured by head gaze and hand position information, including, for instance, time of exploration, moving time towards left/right and time-to-reach, which could be used for the evaluation of the attentional spatial bias with neurological patients. Together with the number of omissions, the new proposed parameters can result in lateralized index ratios as a measure of asymmetry in space exploration. Conclusions: We presented two innovative assessments for USN based on immersive virtual reality, evaluating the far and the near space, using ecological tasks in multimodal, realistic environments. The proposed protocols and objective scores can help distinguish neurological patients with and without USN. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150665940"

The Activity and MObility UsiNg Technology (AMOUNT) rehabilitation trial (n = 300) showed improvements in mobility in people using these types of digital devices in addition to their usual rehabilitation care when the intervention was provided by an additional study-funded physiotherapist. However, it is not clear if this intervention can be implemented by hospital physiotherapists with a usual clinical load. The AMOUNT Implementation trial aims to explore the feasibility of conducting a large-scale implementation trial. Methods: A pragmatic, assessor blinded, feasibility hybrid type II randomized controlled trial will be undertaken at a public hospital in Australia. There will be two phases. Phase I (Implementation phase) will involve implementing the digital devices into physiotherapy practice. Physiotherapists from the rehabilitation ward will receive a multifaceted implementation strategy guided by the Capabilities, Opportunities, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) theoretical model. The implementation strategy includes identifying and training a clinical champion; providing digital devices and education and training; facilitating use of the devices through clinical reasoning sessions and journal clubs; and audit and feedback of exercise dosage documentation. Phase II (Trial phase) will involve randomising 30 eligible inpatients from the same ward into either usual care or usual care plus an additional 30 min or more of exercises using digital devices. This intervention will be provided by the physiotherapists who took part in the implementation phase. We will collect data on feasibility, implementation, and patient-level clinical outcomes. The three primary outcome measures are the extent to which physiotherapists document the dosage of exercises provided to participants (feasibility criteria: exercise practice sheets complete for ≥85% of all participants); ability to recruit participants; and fidelity to the protocol of using digital devices to prescribe exercises (feasibility criteria: average of ≥ 30mins per day for > 50% intervention participants). Discussion: This feasibility study will provide important information to guide the planning and conduct of a future large-scale implementation trial.

Accurate adjustments of the minimum toe clearance (MTC) height and step length can prevent older people from falling when walking and responding to hazards. Although older people with diabetes fall more frequently than healthy older adults, no previous studies have quantified their adaptive gait abilities. This study aimed to investigate the effects of diabetes mellitus on step length and MTC height adjustments using a non-immersive virtual-reality system. Methods: Sixteen young adults (26 ± 5 years, 7 females), 16 healthy older adults (68 ± 5 years, 6 females), and 16 older adults with diabetes (70 ± 5 years, 6 females) completed adaptability tests while walking on a treadmill. A computer system visualised a continuous real-time signal of absolute step length and MTC on a monitor. Each person responded to four discrete participant-specific step length and MTC visual targets that were presented on the same signal. Tasks were to match the peaks of interest on each signal to presented targets. Targets were 10% longer or shorter than the mean baseline step length, and 2.5 cm, and 3.5 cm higher than the mean baseline MTC. When a target was displayed, it remained unchanged for 10 consecutive foot displacement adaptation attempts. Then, the target was removed and a new target or the same target was present after 10 consecutive steps and remained for 10 steps. Each target was randomly presented three times (3 × 10). Step length and MTC height adjustments in response to targets were measured and compared among groups. Results: Mean preferred walking speeds were not different among groups significantly when no targets were presented on the monitor in baseline walking. However, when participants walked on a treadmill while attempting to match step lengths or MTC heights to displayed targets on the monitor, the group with diabetes had reduced step length and MTC adjustments compared with other groups significantly. They showed greater errors (differences between their step lengths/MTC heights and presented targets) on the monitor. Conclusions: This study quantified reduced abilities for older individuals with diabetes to adjust both step length and MTC in response to stimuli compared to healthy older counterparts. Reduced step length and MTC height adjustments can increase falls in at risk populations. The presented virtual-reality system has merits for assessing and training step and MTC adaptation. © 2023, Crown.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158907216"

Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are a central component of self-related navigation but whether they also track others’ movement is unclear. Here, we propose that entorhinal grid-like codes make an essential contribution to socio-spatial navigation. Sixty human participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while observing and re-tracing different paths of a demonstrator that navigated a virtual reality environment. Results revealed that grid-like codes in the entorhinal cortex tracked the other individual navigating through space. The activity of grid-like codes was time-locked to increases in co-activation and entorhinal-cortical connectivity that included the striatum, the hippocampus, parahippocampal and right posterior parietal cortices. Surprisingly, the grid-related effects during observation were stronger the worse participants performed when subsequently re-tracing the demonstrator’s paths. Our findings suggests that network dynamics time-locked to entorhinal grid-cell-related activity might serve to distribute information about the location of others throughout the brain. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147141178"

With the overlap between upper and lower airway disease, optimal management of the upper airways is undertaken in conjunction with that of the lower airways. Biologic therapy with targeted activity within the Type 2 inflammatory pathway can improve the clinical signs and symptoms of both upper and lower airway diseases. Knowledge gaps nevertheless exist in how best to approach patient care as a whole. There have been sixteen randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trails performed for CRSwNP targeted components of the Type 2 inflammatory pathway, notably interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13, IL- 5R, IL-33, and immunoglobulin (Ig)E. This white paper considers the perspectives of experts in various disciplines such as rhinology, allergy, and respirology across Canada, all of whom have unique and valuable insights to contribute on how to best approach patients with upper airway disease from a multidisciplinary perspective. Methods: A Delphi Method process was utilized involving three rounds of questionnaires in which the first two were completed individually online and the third was discussed on a virtual platform with all the panelists. A national multidisciplinary expert panel of 34 certified specialists was created, composed of 16 rhinologists, 7 allergists, and 11 respirologists who evaluated the 20 original statements on a scale of 1–9 and provided comments. All ratings were quantitively reviewed by mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation and inter-rater reliability. Consensus was defined by relative interrater reliability measures—kappa coefficient (κ) value > 0.61. Results: After three rounds, a total of 22 statements achieved consensus. This white paper only contains the final agreed upon statements and clear rationale and support for the statements regarding the use of biologics in patients with upper airway disease. Conclusion: This white paper provides guidance to Canadian physicians on the use of biologic therapy for the management of upper airway disease from a multidisciplinary perspective, but the medical and surgical regimen should ultimately be individualized to the patient. As more biologics become available and additional trials are published we will provide updated versions of this white paper every few years.

Virtual reality (VR) has many opportunities and challenges for breast cancer patients' rehabilitation and symptom management. The purpose of this systematic review is to look into the benefits and drawbacks of VR interventions for breast cancer patients. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, and the Cochrane Library, from inception until February 6, 2022. The inclusion criteria were: (1) original studies without restriction in study design; (2) a study population consisting of patients with breast cancer; (3) any type of VR-based interventions (immersive and non-immersive); and (5) studies published in English. To assess the risk of bias, the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Tool was used. Results: Eighteen articles were included in this systematic review. The result showed that VR could provide many opportunities for patients with breast cancer, including reducing anxiety, time perception, pain, fatigue, chemotherapy-related symptom distress levels, and depression severity, as well as improvement in the range of motion, strength, and function. Cybersickness symptoms, the weight of headsets and helmets, the quality of the visual image, and the cost of the equipment are some of the challenges in using this technology on these patients. Conclusions: The systematic review showed that VR interventions have opportunities and challenges for patients with breast cancer. VR can be effective for rehabilitation and symptom management and is used in different stages of treatment to improve the condition of patients with breast cancer. However, before using it, the researcher should consider its challenges. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146738742"

Trial design: This prospective single-blind randomized controlled trial compared conventional rehabilitation based on physiotherapy and occupational therapy (control group) with the combination of conventional rehabilitation and specific virtual reality technology (experimental group). Participants were allocated to these groups in a ratio of 1:1. The conventional rehabilitation therapists were blinded to the study, but neither the participants nor the therapist who applied the virtual reality–based therapy could be blinded to the intervention. Participants: Forty-six patients (43 of whom completed the intervention period and follow-up evaluation) were recruited from the Neurology and Rehabilitation units of the Hospital General Universitario of Talavera de la Reina, Spain. Intervention: Each participant completed 15 treatment sessions lasting 150 min/session; the sessions took place five consecutive days/week over the course of three weeks. The experimental group received conventional upper-limb strength and motor training (100 min/session) combined with specific virtual reality technology devices (50 min/session); the control group received only conventional training (150 min/session). Results: As measured by the Ashworth Scale, a decrease in wrist muscle tone was observed in both groups (control and experimental), with a notably larger decrease in the experimental group (baseline mean/postintervention mean: 1.22/0.39; difference between baseline and follow-up: 0.78; 95% confidence interval: 0.38–1.18; effect size = 0.206). Fugl-Meyer Assessment scores were observed to increase in both groups, with a notably larger increase in the experimental group (total motor function: effect size = 0.300; mean: − 35.5; 95% confidence interval: − 38.9 to − 32.0; wrist: effect size = 0.290; mean: − 5.6; 95% confidence interval: − 6.4 to − 4.8; hand: effect size = 0.299; mean: − -8.9; 95% confidence interval: − 10.1 to − 7.6). On the Action Research Arm Test, the experimental group quadrupled its score after the combined intervention (effect size = 0.321; mean: − 32.8; 95% confidence interval: − 40.1 to − 25.5). Conclusion: The outcomes of the study suggest that conventional rehabilitation combined with a specific virtual reality technology system can be more effective than conventional programs alone in improving hand motor function and voluntary movement and in normalizing muscle tone in subacute stroke patients. With combined treatment, hand and wrist functionality and motion increase; resistance to movement (spasticity) decreases and remains at a reduced level.

The thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) plays an important role in differentiation process. We aim to find a therapeutic target in redifferentiation strategies for thyroid cancer. Methods: Our study integrated the differentially expressed genes acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus database by comparing TSHR expression levels in the Cancer Genome Atlas database. We conducted functional enrichment analysis and verified the expression of these genes by RT-PCR in 68 pairs of thyroid tumor and paratumor tissues. Artificial intelligence-enabled virtual screening was combined with the VirtualFlow platform for deep docking. Results: We identified five genes (KCNJ16, SLC26A4, TG, TPO, and SYT1) as potential cancer treatment targets. TSHR and KCNJ16 were downregulated in the thyroid tumor tissues, compared with paired normal tissues. In addition, KCNJ16 was lower in the vascular/capsular invasion group. Enrichment analyses revealed that KCNJ16 may play a significant role in cell growth and differentiation. The inward rectifier potassium channel 5.1 (Kir5.1, encoded by KCNJ16) emerged as an interesting target in thyroid cancer. Artificial intelligence-facilitated molecular docking identified Z2087256678_2, Z2211139111_1, Z2211139111_2, and PV-000592319198_1 (-7.3 kcal/mol) as the most potent commercially available molecular targeting Kir5.1. Conclusion: This study may provide greater insights into the differentiation features associated with TSHR expression in thyroid cancer, and Kir5.1 may be a potential therapeutic target in the redifferentiation strategies for recurrent and metastatic thyroid cancer. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159664704"

Upper limb (UL) motor skill, is an important ability in manipulating VR systems and represents the brain’s regulation of movements using the UL muscles. In this study, we used a haptic-feedback Virtual Box and Block Test (VBBT) system and an Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) to examine age-related differences in UL motor performance and intrinsic motivation in VR use. The findings will be helpful for the development of VR applications for older adults. Methods: In total, 48 young and 47 older volunteers participated in our study. The parameters including VBBT score, number of velocity peaks, velocity, grasping force and trajectory length were calculated to represent the task performance, manual dexterity, coordination, perceptive ability and cognitive ability in this study. Results: Age-related differences could be found in all the parameters (all p < 0.05) in VR use. Regression analysis revealed that the task performance of young adults was predicted by the velocity and trajectory length (R2 = 64.0%), while that of older adults was predicted by the number of velocity peaks (R2 = 65.6%). Additionally, the scores of understandability, relaxation and tiredness were significantly different between the two groups (all p < 0.05). In older adults, the understandability score showed large correlation with the IMI score (|r| = 0.576, p < 0.001). In young adults, the correlation was medium (|r| = 0.342, p = 0.017). No significant correlation was found between the IMI score and VBBT score (|r| = 0.142, p = 0.342) in older adults, while a medium correlation (|r| = 0.342, p = 0.017) was found in young adults. Conclusions: The findings demonstrated that decreased smoothness in motor skills dominated the poor VR manipulation in older adults. The experience of understandability is important for older adults’ intrinsic motivation in VR use. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85156266789"

This study focuses on the assessment of facial recognition of emotions in patients with depression through a new set of dynamic virtual faces (DVFs). The sample consisted of 54 stable patients compared to 54 healthy controls. The experiment consisted in an emotion recognition task using non-immersive virtual reality (VR) with DVFs of six basic emotions and neutral expression. Patients with depression showed a worst performance in facial affect recognition compared to healthy controls. Age of onset was negatively correlated with emotion recognition and no correlation was observed for duration of illness or number of lifetime hospitalizations. There was no correlation for the depression group between emotion recognition and degree of psychopathology, excessive rumination, degree of functioning, or quality of life. Hence, it is important to improve and validate VR tools for emotion recognition to achieve greater methodological homogeneity of studies and to be able to establish more conclusive results. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152346731"

Reducing EC is one of the key research priorities to address security of fermented foods. Enzymatic degradation of EC with EC hydrolase in food is the most reliable and efficient method. However, poor tolerance to ethanol severely hinders application of EC hydrolase. In this study, the mutants of EC hydrolase were screened by diphasic high pressure molecular dynamic simulations (dHP-MD). The best variant with remarkable improvement in specific activity and was H68A/K70R/S325N, whose specific activity was approximately 3.42-fold higher than WT, and relative enzyme activity under 20% (v/v) was 5.02-fold higher than WT. Moreover, the triple mutant increased its stability by acquiring more hydration shell and forming extra hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, the ability of degrading EC of the immobilized triple mutant was both detected in mock wine and under certain reaction conditions.

However, perturbation interventions were heterogeneous in nature and need improvement. This study aims to investigate the effects of a PBT protocol that was designed to address previously identified challenges of PBT, in addition to usual care, on balance control and fear of falling in older adults at increased risk of falling. Methods: Community-dwelling older adults (age ≥ 65 years) who visited the hospital outpatient clinic due to a fall incident were included. Participants received PBT in addition to usual care (referral to a physiotherapist) versus usual care alone. PBT consisted of three 30-minute sessions in three weeks. Unilateral treadmill belt accelerations and decelerations and platform perturbations (shifts and tilts) were applied during standing and walking on the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN, Motek Medical BV). This dual-belt treadmill embedded in a motion platform with 6 degrees of freedom is surrounded by a 180° screen on which virtual reality environments are projected. Duration and contents of the training were standardised, while training progression was individualised. Fear of falling (FES-I) and balance control (Mini-BESTest) were assessed at baseline and one week post-intervention. Primary analysis compared changes in outcome measures between groups using Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: Eighty-two participants were included (PBT group n = 39), with a median age of 73 years (IQR 8 years). Median Mini-BESTest scores did not clinically relevantly improve and were not significantly different between groups post-intervention (p = 0.87). FES-I scores did not change in either group. Conclusions: Participation in a PBT program including multiple perturbation types and directions did not lead to different effects than usual care on clinical measures of balance control or fear of falling in community-dwelling older adults with a recent history of falls. More research is needed to explore how to modulate PBT training dose, and which clinical outcomes are most suitable to measure training effects on balance control.

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a widely accepted tool that enhances physicians’ ability to assess proper stent appositions during clinical procedures. The primary aim of this study was to develop complementary post-procedure imaging methodologies to better assess and interpret outcomes of left main PCI procedures, utilizing both reanimated and perfusion-fixed human hearts. Methods: PCIs were performed while obtaining OCT scans within the left main anatomies of six human hearts. Subsequently, each heart was scanned with a micro-CT scanner with optimized parameters to achieve resolutions up to 20 µm. Scans were reconstructed and imported into a DICOM segmentation software to generate computational models of implanted stents and associated coronary vessels. 2D images from OCT that were obtained during PCIs were compared to the 3D models generated from micro-CT reconstructions. In addition, the 3D models were utilized to create virtual reality scenes and enlarged 3D prints for development of “mixed reality” tools relative to bifurcation stenting within human left main coronary arteries. Results: We developed reproducible methodologies for post-implant analyses of coronary artery stenting procedures. In addition, we generated high-resolution 3D computational models, with ~ 20-micron resolutions, of PCIs performed within reanimated and perfusion-fixed heart specimens. Conclusions: Generated computational models of left main PCIs performed in isolated human hearts can be used to obtain detailed measurements that provide further clinical insights on procedural outcomes. The 3D models from these procedures are useful for generating virtual reality scenes and 3D prints for physician training and education. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150665722"

According to current evidence, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted airborne in aerosol particles during resuscitation. Research evidence found an alarming global increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests during the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare providers are legally obliged to respond to cardiac arrest as soon as possible. Chiropractors will likely encounter potential exercise-related and non-exercise-related cardiac emergencies at some point in their professional lives. They have a duty of care to respond to emergencies such as cardiac arrest. Chiropractors are increasingly involved in providing care, including emergency care, for athletes and spectators at sporting events. Also, exercise-related cardiac arrest in adult patients may occur during exercise testing or rehabilitation with exercise prescriptions in chiropractic and other healthcare settings. Little is known about the COVID-19 BLS guidelines for chiropractors. Knowledge of the current COVID-19-specific adult BLS guidelines is essential to developing an emergency response plan for the on-field and sideline management of exercise-related cardiac arrest and non-athletic, non-exercise-related cardiac arrest. Main text: Seven peer-reviewed articles on the COVID-19-specific BLS guidelines, including two updates, were reviewed for this commentary. Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, the national and international resuscitation organizations recommended interim COVID-19-specific BLS guidelines with precaution, resuscitation, and education strategies. BLS safety is paramount. A precautionary approach with the bare minimum of appropriate personal protective equipment for resuscitation is recommended. There was disagreement among the COVID-19 BLS guidelines on the level of personal protective equipment. All healthcare professionals should also undergo self-directed BLS e-learning and virtual skill e-training. The summarized COVID-19-specific adult BLS guideline strategies and protocols are tabled, respectively. Conclusions: This commentary provides a practical overview and highlights current evidence-based intervention strategies of the COVID-19-specific adult BLS guidelines that may help chiropractors and other healthcare providers reduce BLS-related exposures to SARS-CoV-2 and the risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and maximize the efficacy of resuscitation. This study is relevant to and impacts future COVID-19-related research in areas such as infection prevention and control. © 2023, The Author(s).","Note","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160977546"

Only by physical interaction within an environment can we measure true physical distances. Here, we investigated the possibility that travel distances, measured during walking, could be used to calibrate visual spatial perception. The sensorimotor contingencies that arise during walking were carefully altered using virtual reality and motion tracking. Participants were asked to walk to a briefly highlighted location. During walking, we systematically changed the optic flow, i.e., the ratio between the visual and physical motion speed. Although participants remained unaware of this manipulation, they walked a shorter or longer distance as a function of the optic flow speed. Following walking, participants were required to estimate the perceived distance of visual objects. We found that visual estimates were serially dependent on the experience of the manipulated flow in the previous trial. Additional experiments confirmed that to affect visual perception, both visual and physical motion are required. We conclude that the brain constantly uses movements to measure space for both, actions, and perception. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148971526"

The transition is estimated to occur between the 6th and the 12th year of age. The mechanisms underlying spatial encoding in children and adults are unclear, as well as those underlying the transition. Here, we investigated the role of the subjective straight-ahead (SSA), the body antero-posterior half-plane mental model, in spatial encoding before and after the expected transition. We tested 6–7-year-old and 10–11-year-old children, and adults on a spatial alignment task in virtual reality, searching for differences in performance when targets were placed frontally or sideways. The performance differences were assessed both in a naturalistic baseline condition and in a test condition that discouraged using body-centered coordinates through a head-related visuo-motor conflict. We found no differences in the baseline condition, while all groups showed differences between central and lateral targets (SSA effect) in the visuo-motor conflict condition, and 6–7-year-old children showed the largest effect. These results confirm the expected transition timing; moreover, they suggest that children can abstract from the body using their SSA and that the transition underlies the maturation of a world-centered reference frame. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153442623"

Few studies have included the biological stress response for measuring stress. While aerobic exercise can lower stress and repetitive behaviors, motivating adults with disabilities to exercise can be challenging. This study examined whether virtual reality (VR) exercise would improve behavior and stress physiology. Methods: Seven males with ASD participated. This study employed a single subject withdrawal design, using a baseline phase, followed by alternating intervention (i.e., VR biking) and withdrawal (i.e., no exercise) conditions. Frequency and/or duration of repetitive behaviors were assessed. Pre-post intervention hair cortisol and salivary cortisol for each phase were collected. Results: Overall, repetitive behaviors were lower in the final phase (M = 24.28, SD = 2.42) compared to baseline (M = 36.68, SD = 5.33). There was no significant difference in basal T1 cortisol levels across phases (χ2(6) = 2.571, p <.276); however, four participants showed cortisol levels that decreased markedly following the first intervention and remained low for the duration of the study. There was a significant difference in the cortisol levels of participants by pre and post intervention status (first intervention phase, B) as measured by AUCg (χ2(1) = 7.00, p <.008). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that exercise can have acute and cumulative effects on basal cortisol levels and repetitive behaviors for adults with ASD, particularly those with higher cortisol levels and rates of behaviors. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150288955"

The implementation of alternative methods like VR to reduce labour pain can contribute to reduce patient request for pharmacological pain management methods and associated side effects. The aim of this study is to examine women’s experiences, preferences and satisfaction in regard to the use of VR during labour. Methods: A qualitative interview study was conducted in a non-university teaching hospital in The Netherlands. Two VR applications, respectively a guided meditation and an interactive game were tested in eligible women with a singleton pregnancy, scheduled for induction of labour. For the primary outcome, patients’ VR experience and application preference (meditation vs. game) were examined using a post-intervention questionnaire and a semi-structured interview. Three categories (with sub-categories) were used to guide interviews: “The VR experience”, “Pain reduction”, and “Usability of the VR application”. Labour pain before and directly after VR was evaluated using the NRS score. Results: Twenty-four women, of whom 14 were nulliparous and ten multiparous, were included and 12 of these women participated in semi-structured interviews. Using within-subject paired t-test comparisons, compared to pain pre-VR, patients reported a highly significant 26% decrease in mean NRS scores during VR meditation (pain pre-VR = 6.71 + − 1.65 vs. pain after VR = 4.96 + − 2.01) [p < 0.001]. Compared to pain before VR game, patients also reported a highly significant 19% decrease in mean NRS scores during VR game (pain before VR game = 6.89 + − 1.88 vs. pain after VR game = 5.61 + − 2.23) [p = 0.001]. Conclusion: All women were highly satisfied with VR use during labour. Patients reported a highly significant reduction in pain during the interactive VR game and during meditation, patients preferred guided meditation. These results can contribute to the development of a potential promising new non-pharmacological tool to reduce labour pain.

The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate 3WP expansion strategies for patients cared for on General Internal Medicine (GIM) wards in our hospital. Methods: From January 2020-November 2021, we developed a phased, multicomponent approach for program expansion. We enrolled patients on the GIM wards who had a high probability of dying in hospital, then elicited, implemented, and documented wishes for them or their families. Data were analyzed descriptively. Results: From March 2020 to November 2020, we implemented staff education and engagement activities, created an Expansion Coordinator position, held strategic consultations, and offered enabling resources. From March 2020 to November 2021, we enrolled 62 patients and elicited 281 wishes (median [1st, 3rd quartiles] 4 [4, 5] wishes/patient). The most common wish categories were personalizing the environment (67 wishes, 24%), rituals and spiritual support (42 wishes, 15%), and facilitating connections (39 wishes, 14%). The median [1st, 3rd] cost/patient was $0 [0, $10.00] (range $0 to $86); 91% of wishes incurred no cost to the program. Conclusions: The formal expansion of the 3WP on GIM wards has been successful despite COVID-19 pandemic disruptions. While there is still work ahead, these data suggest that implementing the 3WP on the GIM wards is feasible and affordable. Increased engagement of the clinical team during the pandemic suggests that it is positively received. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148109956"

Consequently, this fundamental paper defines it as: “A Metaverse is a massively scaled and interoperable meta-ecosystem of other digital ecosystems of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an unlimited number of complementors and consumers with an increased user experience caused by a creativity-guided co-creation of goods managed by orchestrators and supported by platform owners.” Consequently, the metaverse offers vast opportunities for digital innovations beyond traditional social media or computer games and creates new infrastructures for add-on innovations in all areas of the digital economy. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158033602"

High defect concentrations and crystalline film fracturing at the bottom interface substantially reduce the efficiency and operational stability. In this work, a liquid crystal elastomer interlayer is intercalated into a flexible device with the charge transfer channel toughened by the aligned mesogenic assembly. The molecular ordering is instantly locked upon photopolymerization of liquid crystalline diacrylate monomers and dithiol-terminated oligomers. The optimized charge collection and the minimized charge recombination at the interface boost the efficiency up to 23.26% and 22.10% for rigid and flexible devices, respectively. The liquid crystal elastomer-induced suppression of phase segregation endows the unencapsulated device maintaining >80% of the initial efficiency for 1570 h. Moreover, the aligned elastomer interlayer preserves the configuration integrity with remarkable repeatability and mechanical robustness, which enables the flexible device to retain 86% of its original efficiency after 5000 bending cycles. The flexible solar cell chips are further integrated into a wearable haptic device with microneedle-based arrays of sensors to demonstrate a pain sensation system in virtual reality. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149293414"

The related effectiveness on patients’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has been investigated across neurological populations but still remains unclear. The present study aimed to systematically review the studies investigating the effects of RAT alone and with VR on HRQoL in patients with different neurological diseases. Methods: A systematic review of the studies evaluating the impact of RAT alone and combined with VR on HRQoL in patients affected by neurological diseases (i.e., stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Parkinson’s Disease) was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Electronic searches of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, and PsychINFO (2000–2022) were performed. Risk of bias was evaluated through the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tool. Descriptive data regarding the study design, participants, intervention, rehabilitation outcomes, robotic device typology, HRQoL measures, non-motor factors concurrently investigated, and main results were extracted and meta-synthetized. Results: The searches identified 3025 studies, of which 70 met the inclusion criteria. An overall heterogeneous configuration was found regarding the study design adopted, intervention procedures and technological devices implemented, rehabilitation outcomes (i.e., related to both upper and lower limb impairment), HRQoL measures administered, and main evidence. Most of the studies reported significant effects of both RAT and RAT plus VR on patients HRQoL, whether they adopted generic or disease-specific HRQoL measures. Significant post-intervention within-group changes were mainly found across neurological populations, while fewer studies reported significant between-group comparisons, and then, mostly in patients with stroke. Longitudinal investigations were also observed (up to 36 months), but significant longitudinal effects were exclusively found in patients with stroke or multiple sclerosis. Finally, concurrent evaluations on non-motor outcomes beside HRQoL included cognitive (i.e., memory, attention, executive functions) and psychological (i.e., mood, satisfaction with the treatment, device usability, fear of falling, motivation, self-efficacy, coping, and well-being) variables. Conclusions: Despite the heterogeneity observed among the studies included, promising evidence was found on the effectiveness of RAT and RAT plus VR on HRQoL. However, further targeted short- and long-term investigations, are strongly recommended for specific HRQoL subcomponents and neurological populations, through the adoption of defined intervention procedures and disease-specific assessment methodology. © 2023, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148549994"

Recently, they have also been utilised in adaptive optics, active switching, and next-generation displays for augmented and virtual reality. In order to determine relevant quantities for thermotropic uniaxial nematic liquid crystals (NLCs), our aim is to assess the applicability of a ground-breaking method. The method being discussed is based on Fresnel diffraction (FD) from phase objects, which has been employed over the past 20 years in several accurate and precise metrological applications. Using a phase step and quantitatively registering the visibility of the diffraction patterns, diffractometry can transform any change in the order of LCs brought on by a change in temperature into a change in the optical phase. Owing to its low sensitivity to environmental vibrations, inherent compactness, and ease of set up, diffractometry can be used much more effectively than interferometry. Additionally, as a special major feature, if the various phases of a LC have the required transparency, it is possible to record the number of phases in the bulk of the LC, the surface ordering, and the approximate temperature of the phase transitions in a single-shot imaging by applying a suitable temperature gradient. The numerical computations and practical data comparisons from our theoretical considerations demonstrate a very high level of agreement with the output from other currently used methodologies. As we shall see, by addressing some of the faults and inadequacies of existing techniques, this strategy has the potential to both complement and strengthen them. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147557421"

Research suggests that focusing on the most feared aspect might not be necessary, and that distraction with a low cognitive load (e.g., conversation) might enhance exposure. We aimed at systematically testing the efficacy of exposure therapy with focusing vs. conversational distraction, hypothesizing that distracted exposure would yield superior effects. Methods: Thirty-eight patients with acrophobia (specific phobia of heights; clinician-determined) (free from relevant somatic or other mental disorders) were randomly assigned (1:1) to one virtual reality (VR) session of either focused (n = 20) or distracted exposure (n = 18). This monocentric trial took place at a psychiatric university hospital. Results: Both conditions resulted in a significant reduction of acrophobic fear and avoidance, and a significant increase of self-efficacy (primary outcome variables). However, condition did not have a significant effect on any of these variables. Effects were stable at four-week follow-up. Heart rate and skin conductance level indicated significant arousal, but did not differ between conditions. Limitations: Eye-tracking was unavailable, nor did we assess emotions other than fear. Power was limited due to sample size. Conclusions: A balanced exposure protocol combining attention to fear cues with conversational distraction, while not being superior, might be as effective as focused exposure for acrophobia, at least during the initial stages of exposure therapy. These results support previous findings. This study demonstrates how VR can be exploited for therapy process research, as VR supports dismantling designs and the incorporation of online process measures. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153946062"

A recent study found that increased attention to the periphery during vection was correlated with lower self-reported motion sickness susceptibility, which suggests that peripheral attention might be beneficial for avoiding cybersickness. We tested this experimentally by manipulating visual attention to central vs. peripheral fields during VR exposure. We also measured attention to the periphery during vection and motion sickness susceptibility to attempt to replicate the previous results. In Experiment 1, task-relevant cues to target locations were provided in the central or peripheral field during navigation in VR, and we found no differences in motion sickness. In Experiment 2, attention to the center or periphery was manipulated with a dot-probe task during passive VR exposure, and we found that motion sickness was greater in the condition that required attention to the periphery. In both experiments, there was no correlation between baseline attentional allocation and self-reported motion sickness susceptibility. Our results demonstrate that restricting attention to the central visual field can decrease cybersickness, which is consistent with previous findings that cybersickness is greater with large FOV. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150666164"

To further complicate the situation, many international student populations at these institutions were forced to study remotely in their home countries due to the pandemic and visa restrictions. In Canada and Ontario, International students make up a major revenue source for post-secondary institutions, making the need to find viable solutions to continue to serve these populations essential to their financial stability. The Ontario Council of University Libraries (OCUL) runs a shared virtual reference service called Ask a Librarian (Ask). This paper assessed the global pandemic's impact through a comparative study of the service before, during, and after the pandemic's height. Using IP addresses, this study evaluated the impact of geographical location on the user’s access to virtual library resources, as well as identified any barriers, shifts, or trends in the service.

Enabling consumers to compare the environmental impact of food products at point-of-purchase with front-of-pack labelling could be a promising strategy to trigger more environmentally friendly food choices. This strategy remained to be tested. Methods: The effect of a new traffic-light front-of-pack environmental label on food choices was tested in a 2-arm randomised controlled trial in a virtual reality supermarket. Participants (n = 132) chose food products to compose two main meals for an everyday meal scenario and for an environmentally friendly meal scenario with or without the label. The environmental label (ranging from A: green/lowest impact, to E: red/highest impact) was based on the Environmental Footprint (EF) single score calculation across food categories. The effect of the label on the environmental impact of food choices in each scenario was tested using linear mixed models. Results: In the everyday meal scenario, the environmental impact of meals was lower in the label condition than in the no label condition (-0.17 ± 0.07 mPt/kg, p = 0.012). This reduction was observed at no nutritional, financial nor hedonic cost. The effectiveness of the label can be attributed to a change in the food categories chosen: less meat-based and more vegetarian meals were chosen with the label. In the environmentally friendly meal scenario, we demonstrated that the label provided new information to the participants as they were able to further reduce the environmental impact of their food choices with the label (-0.19 ± 0.07 mPt/kg, p = 0.005). Conclusions: Implementing a front-of-pack environmental label on food products in real supermarkets could increase awareness of the environmental impact of food and contribute to drive more environmentally friendly food choices.

Computer-based cognitive interventions (CCIs) have the potential to act as important counteraction functions in preserving or improving cognition concomitant to available pharmacological treatment. The aim was to assess the effectiveness of CCIs performed individually with a personal or tablet computer, game console, virtual, augmented, or mixed reality application on cognition in community-dwelling people with SCD, MCI and dementia. Methods: A systematic review with meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed. The systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO. In addition, a search for gray literature and backward citation searching were carried out. To judge on the evidence, two reviewers independently used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The standardized mean difference (SDM) for pooling comparable studies using the random-effects model was applied. Results: Twenty-four RCTs were identified, of which 1 RCT examined CCIs in individuals with SCD, 18 RCTs with MCI, and 6 RCTs with dementia. Most interventions were conducted with personal computers. Meta-analyses with 12 RCTs showed significant effects of computer-based cognitive interventions for people with MCI in the domains memory, working memory, attention/concentration/processing speed and executive functioning, but no significant improvements in global cognition and language. Regarding dementia a meta-analysis pooled with 4 RCTs demonstrated a tendency towards, but no significant increase of memory functions (SMD 0.33, CI 95% [-0.10, 0.77]). One RCT regarding SCD reported significant improvements in memory functions for participants conducting a cognitive training on a personal computer. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that CCIs have beneficial effects on domain-specific cognition in people with MCI but no significant effects on people with dementia. In terms of SCD, one study showed significant improvements in memory functions. It seems that the beneficial effect for cognitive preservation or improvement due to CCIs occurs at the earliest intervention state. However, more research on SCD is needed.

Gaining clinical nursing competence in the healthcare system requires more effort, and additional training is required. Medical education and training have begun using digital technologies, such as virtual reality (VR). The purpose of this research was to examine the efficacy of VR in terms of cognitive, emotional, and psychomotor outcomes and learning satisfaction in nurses. Method: The study searched eight databases (Cochrane library, EBSCOHost, Embase, OVID MEDLINE, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for articles that met these criteria: (i) nursing staff, (ii) any virtual reality technology intervention for education, all levels of immersion, [1] randomized control trial and quasi-experiment study, and (iv) published articles and unpublished theses. The standardized mean difference was measured. The random effect model was applied to measure the main outcome of the study with a significance level of p <.05. The I2 statistic assessment was applied to identify the level of heterogeneity of the study. Results: A total of 6740 studies were identified, of which 12 studies with 1470 participants met the criteria for inclusion. The meta-analysis showed a significant improvement in the cognitive aspect (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 1.48; 95% CI = 0.33–2.63; p =.011, I 2 = 94.88%), the affective aspect (SMD = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.34–0.86; p <.001, I 2 = 34.33%), the psychomotor aspect (SMD = 0.901; 95% CI = 0.49–1.31; p <.001, I 2 = 80.33%), and learning satisfaction (SMD = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.17–0.77; p =.002, I 2 = 0%) aspects of the groups that received the VR intervention compared to the control groups. Subgroup analysis found that dependent variables (e.g., level of immersion) did not improve study outcomes. The quality of evidence was low which is affected by major methodological issues. Conclusions: VR may favorable as alternative method to increase nurse competencies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on larger samples are needed to strengthen the evidence for the effect of VR in various clinical nurse settings.

Carried out on an awake patient, it can be a source of anxiety. In recent years, hypnotic techniques have been proposed in the management of perioperative anxiety. Among them, virtual reality is increasingly used as a distraction tool during anxious or painful actions despite the scarcity of proof of its benefit in the literature. Before implementing the systematic use of virtual reality when performing regional anaesthesia in our institution, we designed a study hypothesizing that the use of a virtual reality headset when performing an axillary block would reduce patient’s anxiety. The study is an investigator-initiated, prospective monocentric and observational trial comparing anxiety scores of patients who underwent upper limb surgery under an axillary block with or without virtual reality headset. The perioperative anxiety was assessed by a numerical range scale before and after the peripheral nerve block performance. Between June 2021 and June 2022, 99 patients were included: 53 wearing the virtual reality headset and 46 not. The difference in numerical range scale for anxiety before and after the axillary block performance did not differ in the virtual reality group compared to the group without headset (mean = -1.9 ± 2.5 vs -1.5 ± 2.0, (p = 0.2520)). Technical difficulties reported by the operators were similar in both groups. Despite the large number of patients included, the virtual reality headset did not reduce patient’s anxiety during a peripheral nerve block. Perioperative anxiety was low in all patients. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149215720"

To investigate how such benefits might generalize to ever-more-prevalent virtual workplaces, we examined the effects of the absence or presence of virtual plants in an office environment in Virtual Reality (VR) on users’ cognitive performance and psychological well-being. The results of our user study with 39 participants show that in the presence of virtual plants, participants performed significantly better in both short-term memory and creativity tasks. Furthermore, they reported higher psychological well-being scores, including positive affect and attentive coping, whilst reporting lower feelings of anger and aggression after exposure to virtual plants in VR. The virtual office with plants was also perceived as more restorative and induced a higher sense of presence. Overall, these results highlight how the presence of virtual plants in VR can have positive influences on users, and therefore, constitute important design considerations when developing future working and learning spaces. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159758928"

Any abnormality in these systems could lead to deficits in SMC, which would negatively impact an individual's ability to execute goal-directed motions. Recent studies have shown that patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) have dysfunctions in sensory, motor, and cognitive systems, which could give rise to SMC deficits. However, SMC deficits in PD and how they affect a patient's upper-limb movements have not been well understood. The objective of the study was to investigate SMC deficits in PD and how they affect the planning and correction of upper-limb motions. This was accomplished using a robotic manipulandum equipped with a virtual-reality system. Twenty age-matched healthy controls and fifty-six PD patients (before and after medication) completed an obstacle avoidance task under dynamic conditions (target and obstacles in moving or stationary form, with and without mechanical perturbations). Kinematic information from the robot was used to extract eighteen features that evaluated the SMC functions of the participants. The findings show that the PD patients before medication were 32% slower, reached 16% fewer targets, hit 41% more obstacles, and were 26% less efficient than the control participants, and the difference in these features was statistically significant under dynamic conditions. In addition to the motor deficits, the PD patients also showed deficits in handling high cognitive loads and interpreting sensory cues. Further, the PD patients after medication exhibited worse sensory and cognitive performance than before medication under complex testing conditions. The PD patients also showed deficits in following the computational models leading to poor motor planning. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150876380"

The two outcomes together constitute GPTS and the unifying concept we attempt to treat, namely paranoid ideations.

Insights into cognitive mechanisms reflected by embodied interaction with food and its connections to clinically relevant psychopathology offer new possibilities for translational diagnostics and interventions. We longitudinally investigated the manual interaction with food in a virtual reality (VR) in 31 patients with BED. Patients were assessed at baseline before participating in a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) investigating a computer-based inhibitory control training programme enhanced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and at a 6-week follow-up. At both assessments, an experimental VR paradigm was conducted and patients were characterized concerning eating disorder psychopathology, eating behaviour, general impulsivity and food craving. In the experimental task, one of two simultaneously presented objects (food vs. office tools) had to be collected. Food was recognized faster than office tools and subsequent approach behaviour was initiated faster, whereas thereafter, food was collected slower than office tools. Exploratory, we could not find a modulatory effect of applied tDCS on the interaction with food. No relationship between behavioural biases and sample characterizations could be detected. Two different stages in the manual interaction with food were found: a faster first stage that comprises recognition and movement initiation and a slower second stage that comprises controlled handling and may reflect aversive motivational processes. As the behavioural patterns do not change with an ameliorated BED-psychopathology at the second assessment, the task seems insensitive in detecting translational interconnections between behavioural biases and BED-characteristics.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 82 participants with NS-LBP and/or NPD who received exercise therapy delivered solely in the metaverse using virtually reality. The study was to determine if this was achievable, safe, had appropriate outcome measures that could be collected, and if there was any early evidence of beneficial effects. Results: The study demonstrated that virtual reality treatment delivered via the metaverse appears to be safe (no adverse events or side effects).

Considering mixed evidence from previous neurofeedback research, we present a novel feedback system that relies on gaze behavior to detect signs of inattention while performing a neuropsychological attention task in a virtual seminar room. More specifically, an audiovisual feedback was given whenever participants averted their gaze from the given task. Methods: Eighteen adults with ADHD and 18 healthy controls performed a continuous performance task (CPT) in virtual reality under three counterbalanced conditions in which either gaze-based feedback, sham feedback, or no feedback was provided. In all conditions, phases of high and low virtual distraction alternated. CPT errors and reaction times, proportions of gaze dwell times (e.g., task focus or distraction focus), saccade characteristics, EEG theta/beta ratios, head movements, and an experience sampling of ADHD symptoms were analyzed. Results: While patients can be discriminated well from healthy controls in that they showed more omission errors, higher reaction times, higher distraction-related dwell times, and more head movements, the feedback did not immediately improve task performance. It was also indicated that sham feedback was rather associated with an aggravation of symptoms in patients. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate sufficient suitability and specificity for this holistic ADHD symptom assessment. Regarding the feedback, a single-session training was insufficient to achieve learning effects based on the proposed metacognitive strategies. Future longitudinal, multi-session trials should conclusively examine the therapeutic efficacy of gaze-based virtual reality attention training in ADHD.

Mainly, the effect of IVR on learning outcomes has been the focus. However, far too little attention has been paid to the influence of game elements and IVR features on learners’ perceived cognition. This study examined the relationship between game elements (challenge, goal clarity, and feedback) as pedagogical approach, features of IVR technology (immersion and interaction), and learners’ perceived cognition (reflective thinking and comprehension). An experiment was conducted with 49 undergraduate students who played an IVR game-based application (iThinkSmart) containing mini games developed to facilitate learners’ computational thinking competency. The study employed partial least squares structural equation modelling to investigate the effect of educational game elements and learning contents on learner’s cognition. Findings show that goal clarity is the main predictor of learners’ reflective thinking and comprehension in an educational game-based IVR application. It was also confirmed that immersion and interaction experience impact learner’s comprehension. Notably, adequate learning content in terms of the organisation and relevance of the content contained in an IVR game-based application significantly moderate learners’ reflective thinking and comprehension. The findings of this study have implications for educators and developers of IVR game-based intervention to facilitate learning in the higher education context. In particular, the implication of this study touches on the aspect of learners’ cognitive factors that aim to produce 21st-century problem-solving skills through critical thinking. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148892400"

A virtual reality (VR)-based restorative environment has shown to be an effective new technique to reduce stress and improve cognitive performance, but little is known about its mechanism of improving neuronal activity and connectivity. Methods: This is a randomized, controlled, single-center clinical trial. A total of 140 medical staff will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 allocation to either the VR immersion group (intervention group) or the control group. In the morning after the night shift, the participants in the intervention group will watch 360° panoramic videos of immersive VR natural restorative environments for 10 min, while the participants in the control group will just rest for 10 min. Assessments of abbreviated Profile of Mood States Questionnaire (POMS) and verbal fluency task (VFT) performances, as well as oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) and total hemoglobin concentration acquired by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will be performed at baseline (day work), the morning after night shift but before the intervention (previous) and after intervention (post). Data collected after a night shift will be compared to baseline performance as well as between the two groups. Discussion: This trial will investigate the effects of the night shift and VR-based restorative environment intervention on mood, cognitive performance, and neuronal activity and connectivity. A positive result in this trial could encourage hospitals to apply VR technology to reduce physical and mental dysfunction during of night shifts among medical staff in every department. Furthermore, the findings from this study will contribute to understanding the underlying neuromodulation mechanisms of how restorative environments influence mood and cognition.

However, the restraint of the less-affected upper extremity and intensive training protocol during CIMT may decrease children’s motivation and increase the therapist’s workload and family’s burden. A kinect-based CIMT program, aiming to mitigate the concerns of CIMT, has been developed. The preliminary results demonstrated that this program was child-friendly and feasible for improving upper extremity motor function. However, whether the kinect-based CIMT can achieve better or at least comparable effects to that of traditional CIMT (i.e., therapist-based CIMT) should be further investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of kinect-based CIMT with that of therapist-based CIMT on upper extremity and trunk motor control and on daily motor function in children with UCP. Methods: Twenty-nine children with UCP were recruited and randomly allocated to kinect-based CIMT (n = 14) or therapist-based CIMT (n = 15). The intervention dosage was 2.25 h a day, 2 days a week for 8 weeks. Outcome measures, namely upper extremity and trunk motor control and daily motor function, were evaluated before and after 36-h interventions. Upper extremity and trunk motor control were assessed with unimanual reach-to-grasp kinematics, and daily motor function was evaluated with the Revised Pediatric Motor Activity Log. Between-group comparisons of effectiveness on all outcome measures were analyzed by analysis of covariance (α = 0.05). Results: The two groups demonstrated similar improvements in upper extremity motor control and daily motor function. In addition, the kinect-based CIMT group demonstrated greater improvements in trunk motor control than the therapist-based CIMT group did (F(1,28) > 4.862, p < 0.036). Conclusion: Kinect-based CIMT has effects comparable to that of therapist-based CIMT on UE motor control and daily motor function. Moreover, kinect-based CIMT helps decrease trunk compensation during reaching in children with UCP. Therefore, kinect-based CIMT can be used as an alternative approach to therapist-based CIMT.

Causes of these problems are multifaceted, but culminate in difficulties with interacting in daily life social situations. Current treatments have only moderate effects on social functioning and often target one specific domain. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to improve the treatment of social interaction difficulties. We developed a modular VR treatment for social functioning and participation (VR-SOAP). In this study, the effect of this intervention will be investigated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods: A total of 116 participants (age 18–40) with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorder and problems with social functioning will be recruited from mental healthcare institutes in the Netherlands. Participants will be randomized to the experimental condition (VR-SOAP) or active VR control condition (VRelax). VR-SOAP consists of 14 sessions and 5 modules addressing causes of impaired social functioning: four optional modules (1–4) and one fixed module (5). Vrelax consists of 14 sessions that entail psychoeducation, stress management, relaxation techniques, and the exploration of relaxing environments in VR. Primary outcomes are quantity and quality of social contacts, leisure activities and social participation, measured with the experience sampling method (ESM). Secondary outcomes are psychiatric symptoms, social behaviour, social cognition, self-esteem, self-stigma and paranoid thoughts. Treatment effects will be compared at pre-treatment (baseline), post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up. Discussion: If VR-SOAP proves to be effective, it provides therapists with a much-needed tool to improve social functioning of young adults with a psychotic disorder. Additionally, since the treatment consists of multiple modules targeting different transdiagnostic factors, this trial might provide input for new treatments to improve social functioning in a range of symptoms and disorders, e.g. mood, autism spectrum and anxiety disorders.

The purpose of this study was to capture UK public opinions and attitudes to novel healthcare technologies (NHTs), and to better understand the factors that contribute to acceptance and future use. Methods: An online survey was distributed to the UK public between April and May 2020. Respondents received brief information about four novel healthcare technologies (NHTs) in development: a laser-based tool for early diagnosis of osteoarthritis, a virtual reality tool to support diabetes self-management, a non-invasive continuous glucose monitor using microwave signals, a mobile app for patient reported monitoring of rheumatoid arthritis. They were queried on their general familiarity and attitudes to technology, and their willingness to accept each NHT in their future care. Responses were analysed using summary statistics and content analysis. Results: Knowledge about NHTs was diverse, with respondents being more aware about the health applications of mobile apps (66%), followed by laser-based technology (63.8%), microwave signalling (28%), and virtual reality (18.3%). Increasing age and the presence of a self-reported medical condition favoured acceptability for some NHTs, whereas self-reported understanding of how the NHT works resulted in elevated acceptance scores across all NHTs presented. Common contributors to hesitancy were safety and risks from use. Respondents wanted more information and evidence to help inform their decisions, ideally provided verbally by a general practitioner or health professional. Other concerns, such as privacy, were NHT-specific but equally important in decision-making. Conclusions: Early insight into the knowledge and preconceptions of the public about NHTs in development can assist their design and prospectively mitigate obstacles to acceptance and adoption. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148550838"

This study aimed to examine the effect of metaverse-based career mentoring among nursing students and explore the experiences of mentors and mentees. Methods: This study used a mixed methods design using both a survey for collecting quantitative data and focus group interviews for a qualitative one. A total of 8 mentors and 43 mentees participated in the metaverse-based career mentoring program. The program covered eight career fields and was delivered across eight sessions of 60 min each, over six days. Career decision-making self-efficacy among mentees and platform and program satisfaction were measured before and after the program. Afterwards, 7 mentors and 12 mentees participated in the focus group interviews to investigate their experience of participating in the metaverse-based career mentoring program. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, paired t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Mann-Whitney U test. The qualitative data underwent thematic analysis. Results: After the metaverse-based career mentoring program, mentees’ career decision-making self-efficacy increased significantly compared to the baseline level. From the mentor–mentee focus group interviews, three key themes were derived: (i) communicating frankly and openly, (ii) being satisfied with realistic communication and program functions, and (iii) expecting an even more optimized program. Conclusions: A metaverse-based career mentoring program for nursing students can have a positive effect on their career decision-making self-efficacy. In addition, in terms of education, it is helpful as a non-face-to-face medium and feeling a sense of reality, so it is expected that it will be beneficial in education by applying various contents in the future. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159176721"

With the development of locking plates, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the proximal humerus can provide excellent clinical outcomes. The quality of fracture reduction is crucial in the locking plate fixation of proximal humeral fractures. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of 3-dimensional (3D) printing technology and computer virtual technology assisted preoperative simulation on the reduction quality and clinical outcomes of 3-part and 4-part proximal humeral fractures. Method: A retrospective comparative analysis of 3-part and 4-part PHFs undergoing open reduction internal fixation was performed. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to whether computer virtual technology and 3D printed technology were used for preoperative simulation: the simulation group and the conventional group. Operative time, intraoperative bleeding, hospital stay, quality of fracture reduction, Constant scores, American Society for Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (ASES) scores, shoulder range of motion, complications, and revision surgeries were assessed. Results: This study included 67 patients (58.3%) in the conventional group and 48 patients (41.7%) in the simulation group. The patient demographics and fracture characteristics were comparable in these groups. Compared with the conventional group, the simulation group had shorter operation time and less intraoperative bleeding (P < 0.001, both). Immediate postoperative assessment of fracture reduction showed a higher incidence of greater tuberosity cranialization of < 5 mm, neck-shaft angle of 120° to 150°, and head shaft displacement of < 5 mm in the simulation group. The incidence of good reduction was 2.6 times higher in the simulation group than in the conventional group (95% CI, 1.2–5.8). At the final follow-up, the chance of forward flexion > 120° (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.8–18.0) and mean constant score of > 65 (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.5–7.4) was higher in the simulation group than the conventional group, as well as a lower incidence of complications in the simulation group was obtained (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1–0.6). Conclusions: This study identified that preoperative simulation assisted by computer virtual technology and 3D printed technology can improve reduction quality and clinical outcomes in treatment of 3-part and 4-part PHFs. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151316119"

There is promising evidence supporting use of virtual reality (VR) to target psychological symptoms in other solid tumor patients, though PBT patients have not been studied extensively in this context. The primary aim of this phase 2 clinical trial is to establish the feasibility of a remote VR-based relaxation intervention for a PBT population, with secondary aims designed to determine preliminary efficacy of improving distress and anxiety symptoms. Methods: PBT patients (N = 120) with upcoming MRI scans and clinical appointments who meet eligibility will be recruited to participate in a single arm trial conducted remotely through the NIH. Following completion of baseline assessments, participants will complete a 5-min VR intervention via telehealth using a head-mounted immersive device while under supervision of the research team. Following the intervention, over the course of 1 month patients can use VR at their discretion with follow-up assessments done immediately post-VR intervention, as well as 1 week and 4 weeks later. Additionally, a qualitative phone interview will be conducted to assess patient satisfaction with the intervention. Discussion: Use of immersive VR is an innovative interventional approach to target distress and scanxiety symptoms in PBT patients who are at high risk for experiencing these symptoms leading into their clinical appointments.

The Review Manager 5.4 software was applied to compare accuracy of inclination and anteversion, and surgical duration between XR training and conventional methods. Results: We identified 213 articles, of which 4 randomized clinical trials and 1 prospective controlled study including 106 participants met inclusion criteria. The pooled data indicated the XR training had better accuracy of inclination and shorter surgical duration than conventional methods (MD = −2.07, 95% CI [− 4.02 to −0.11], P = 0.04; SMD = −1.30, 95% CI [− 2.01 to −0.60], P = 0.0003), but the accuracy of anteversion was similar in the two groups. Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis found XR training had better accuracy of inclination and shorter surgical duration than conventional methods in THA, but the accuracy of anteversion was similar. Based on the pooled results, we suggested that XR training can better improve trainees’ surgical skills than conventional methods in THA. © 2023, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148550403"

This study aimed to investigate the effects of virtual logotherapy (VL) on health-promoting lifestyle (HPL) among single-parent adolescent girls during the COVID-19 pandemic. This single-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted on 88 single-parent adolescent girls recruited from the support organization for vulnerable individuals in Tehran, Iran. They were randomly allocated to a control and an intervention group through block randomization. Participants in the intervention group received VL in three–five person groups in 90 min biweekly sessions. The Adolescent Health Promotion Short-Form was used to assess HPL. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software (v. 26.0) and through the independent-sample t, Chi-square, Fisher’s exact, and Mann–Whitney U tests. There was no significant difference between the intervention and the control groups respecting the pretest mean score of HPL (73.58±16.74 vs. 72.80±9.30; P=0.085). However, the posttest mean score of HPL in the intervention group (82 with an interquartile range of 78–90) was significantly more than the control group (71.50 with an interquartile range of 63.25–84.50) (P=0.001). Moreover, after adjusting the effects of the significant between-group differences respecting pretest mean scores, the pretest–posttest differences of the mean scores of HPL and all its dimensions in the intervention group were significantly more than the control group (P<0.05). VL is effective in significantly improving HPL among single-parent adolescent girls. Healthcare authorities are recommended to use VL for health promotion among single-parent adolescents.

The initial treatment consists of refractive correction. When insufficient, occlusion therapy may further improve visual acuity. However, the challenges and compliance issues associated with occlusion therapy may result in treatment failure and residual amblyopia. Virtual reality (VR) games developed to improve visual function have shown positive preliminary results. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of these games to improve vision, attention, and motor skills in patients with residual amblyopia and identify brain-related changes. We hypothesize that a VR-based training with the suggested ingredients (3D cues and rich feedback), combined with increasing the difficulty level and the use of various games in a home-based environment is crucial for treatment efficacy of vision recovery, and may be particularly effective in children. Methods: The AMBER study is a randomized, cross-over, controlled trial designed to assess the effect of binocular stimulation (VR-based stereoptic serious games) in individuals with residual amblyopia (n = 30, 6–35 years of age), compared to refractive correction on vision, selective attention and motor control skills. Additionally, they will be compared to a control group of age-matched healthy individuals (n = 30) to account for the unique benefit of VR-based serious games. All participants will play serious games 30 min per day, 5 days per week, for 8 weeks. The games are delivered with the Vivid Vision Home software. The amblyopic cohort will receive both treatments in a randomized order according to the type of amblyopia, while the control group will only receive the VR-based stereoscopic serious games. The primary outcome is visual acuity in the amblyopic eye. Secondary outcomes include stereoacuity, functional vision, cortical visual responses, selective attention, and motor control. The outcomes will be measured before and after each treatment with 8-week follow-up. Discussion: The VR-based games used in this study have been conceived to deliver binocular visual stimulation tailored to the individual visual needs of the patient, which will potentially result in improved basic and functional vision skills as well as visual attention and motor control skills.

A rapid development methodology of a 3D LiDAR-based navigation system for agricultural robots is proposed in this study, which includes: (i) individual plant clustering and its location estimation method (improved Euclidean clustering algorithm); (ii) robot path planning and tracking control method (Lyapunov direct method); (iii) construction of a robot-LiDAR-plant unified virtual simulation environment (combination use of Gazebo and SolidWorks); and (vi) evaluating the accuracy of the navigation system (triple evaluation: virtual simulation test, physical simulation test, and field test). Applying the proposed methodology, a navigation system for a grape field operation robot has been developed. The virtual simulation test, physical simulation test with GNSS as ground truth, and field test with path tracer showed that the robot could travel along the planned path quickly and smoothly. The maximum and mean absolute errors of path tracking are 2.72 cm, 1.02 cm; 3.12 cm, 1.31 cm, respectively, which meet the accuracy requirements of field operations, establishing the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The proposed methodology has good scalability and can be implemented in a wide variety of field robot, which is promising to shorten the development cycle of agricultural robot navigation system working in GNSS-denied environment. © 2023, Shanghai University and Periodicals Agency of Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159675196"

Rehabilitation is a vital component of stroke recovery, but inpatient stroke rehabilitation programs can struggle to meet the recommended hours of therapy per day outlined by the Canadian Stroke Best Practices and American Heart Association. Mobile applications (apps) are an emerging technology which may help bridge this deficit, however this area is understudied. The purpose of this study is to review the effect of mobile apps for stroke rehabilitation on stroke impairments and functional outcomes. Specifically, this paper will delve into the impact of varying mobile app types on stroke rehabilitation. Methods: This systematic review included 29 studies: 11 randomized control trials and 18 quasi-experimental studies. Data extrapolation mapped 5 mobile app types (therapy apps, education apps, rehab videos, reminders, and a combination of rehab videos with reminders) to stroke deficits (motor paresis, aphasia, neglect), adherence to exercise, activities of daily living (ADLs), quality of life, secondary stroke prevention, and depression and anxiety. Results: There were multiple studies supporting the use of therapy apps for motor paresis or aphasia, rehab videos for exercise adherence, and reminders for exercise adherence. For permutations involving other app types with stroke deficits or functional outcomes (adherence to exercise, ADLs, quality of life, secondary stroke prevention, depression and anxiety), the results were either non-significant or limited by a paucity of studies. Conclusion: Mobile apps demonstrate potential to assist with stroke recovery and augment face to face rehabilitation, however, development of a mobile app should be carefully planned when targeting specific stroke deficits or functional outcomes. This study found that mobile app types which mimicked principles of effective face-to-face therapy (massed practice, task-specific practice, goal-oriented practice, multisensory stimulation, rhythmic cueing, feedback, social interaction, and constraint-induced therapy) and education (interactivity, feedback, repetition, practice exercises, social learning) had the greatest benefits.

In a series of six studies (Ntotal = 119,671) over two decades and across two unrelated intractable conflicts in Israel/Palestine and Cyprus, we found that younger (compared to older) generations from both respective rival groups have less hope for peace, and consequently less conciliatory attitudes. We also show that this gradual improvement of peace-promoting emotions and attitudes with increasing age can be experimentally accelerated in young people through a virtual reality-based aging simulation. These findings provide a new perspective on the fundamental question of why long-term conflicts are so difficult to resolve and highlight the importance of instilling hope in young generations to advance peace processes. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150968870"

The Mirrosistant is a device that helps dental students become proficient with use of indirect vision mirror operation. This study aimed to explore the role of the Mirrosistant on students’ performance with the virtual simulation dental training system. Materials and methods: A total of 72 dental students were equally assigned to the Control group and the Experimental group. Subsequently, Mirrosistant was used to conduct a series of mirror training exercises in the Experimental group. The training consisted of tracing the edge and filling in the blank of the prescribed shape, as well as preparing the specified figure on raw eggs using indirect vision via Mirrosistant. Next, both groups were examined using the SIMODONT system, a virtual reality dental trainer, for mirror operation. In addition, a five-point Likert scale questionnaire was used to assess student feedback by using Mirrosistant. Results: The mirror operation examination conducted by the SIMODONT system revealed that mirror training using Mirrosistant had statistically improved students’ performances (score: 80.42 ± 6.43 vs. 69.89 ± 15.98, P = 0.0005) and shorten their performance time of mirror operation (time of seconds: 243.28 ± 132.83 vs. 328.53 ± 111.89, P = 0.0013). Furthermore, the questionnaire survey indicated that the participants had positive attitudes toward the mirror training using Mirrosistant. Most students believed that the mirror training device could improve their perceptions of direction and distance, as well as their sensations of dental operation and dental fulcrum. Conclusion: Mirror training using Mirrosistant can enhance dental students’ mirror perceptual and operational skills on virtual simulation dental training system. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85157972678"

However, current clinical tests are designed to assess form vision and do not provide information about the range of visually guided activities that can be performed in daily life using ULV. This is important to know given the growing number of clinical trials that recruit individuals with ULV (e.g., gene therapy, stem cell therapy) or restore vision to the ULV range in the blind (visual prosthesis). In this study, we develop a set of 19 activities (items) in virtual reality involving spatial localization/detection, motion detection, and direction of motion that can be used to assess visual performance in people with ULV. We estimated measures of item difficulty and person ability on a relative d prime (d′) axis using a signal detection theory based analysis for latent variables. The items represented a range of difficulty levels (− 1.09 to 0.39 in relative d′) in a heterogeneous group of individuals with ULV (− 0.74 to 2.2 in relative d′) showing the instrument’s utility as an outcome measure in clinical trials. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148809860"

Twenty voluntary unpaid preclinical dental students, with different background experience, were enrolled for this study. After the completion of an informed consent, a demographic questionnaire, and being introduced to the prototype (on the first testing session), three testing sessions followed (S1, S2, S3). Each session involved the following steps: (I) free experimentation; (II) task execution; S3 also included (III) completion of questionnaires associated with the experiment (total of 8 Self-Assessment Questions (SAQ)); and (IV) guided interview. As expected, drill time decreased steadily for all tasks when increasing prototype use, verified by RM ANOVA. Regarding performance metrics (Comparisons by Student’s t-test and ANOVA) recorded at S3, in overall, a higher performance was verified for participants with the following characteristics: female, non-gamer, no previous VR experience and with over 2 semesters of previous experience of working on phantom models. The correlation between the participants’ performance (drill time), for the four tasks, and user self-assessment evaluation, verified by Spearman’s rho analysis, allowed to conclude that a higher performance was observed in students who responded that DENTIFY improved their self perception of manual force applied. Regarding the questionnaires, Spearman’s rho analysis showed a positive correlation between the improvement DENTIFY inputs on conventional teaching sensed by students, also enhancing their interest in learning OD, their desire to have more simulator hours and the improvement sensed on manual dexterity. All participating students adhered well to the DENTIFY experimentation. DENTIFY allows for student self-assessment and contributes to improving student performance. Simulators with VR and haptic pens for teaching in OD should be designed as a consistent and gradual teaching strategy, allowing multiplicity of simulated scenarios, bimanual manipulation, and the possibility of real-time feedback to allow for the student’s immediate self-assessment. Additionally, they should create performance reports per student to ensure self-perception/criticism of their evolution over longer periods of learning time. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148353191"

However, evidence comparing the improvement effects of different combinations of the two activities has rarely been reported. By comparing the differences in the improvement effects of four combinations of physical activities and watching natural environment videos on young children’s attention levels, this study can enrich the evidence in this research field and also provide a reference for arranging effective intervention methods for children’s attention recovery between classes. Method: A total of 152 children aged 4 to 6 years were recruited and randomly divided into four intervention groups: (1) physical activity intervention first and thereafter watching a natural environment video group (activity + video group), (2) watching a natural environment video first and thereafter the physical activity intervention group (video + activity group), (3) physical activity-based group, and (4) natural environment video-based group. Physical activity involved 4 min of moderate-intensity basic physical fitness combination training. The subjects wore the Pico Neo pioneer version of the VR glasses all-in-one machine to watch a natural environment video. Thereafter, population sociological variables and daily physical activity levels were investigated. Auditory and visual sustained attention tests were performed before and after intervention in each group. Result: The auditory attention post-test scores of the four groups showed an improvement trend compared with the pretest scores. In particular, the activity + video group (F = 10.828; ɳp2 = 0.226; p = 0.002) and natural environment video-based group (F = 9.452; ɳp2 = 0.203; p = 0.004) have the best improvement effect. For visual attention, only the activity + video group showed a significant improvement trend (F = 4.287; ɳp2 = 0.104; p = 0.045), while the other three groups showed a downward trend in scores. Conclusions: Among the different intervention combinations, the physical activity intervention first and watching natural environment videos thereafter group has the best effect on improving children’s attention during recess. Physical activity interventions at the end of recess adversely affect young children’s visual attention levels at the beginning of the class. Therefore, this study recommends that children should not engage in physical activity interventions in the second half of the class break. Lastly, the current research recommends presenting the content of physical activity interventions first and further improving their attention thereafter by watching natural environment videos. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147373063"

Modern approaches, such as robotic-assisted rehabilitation can help to improve rehabilitation processes and thus improve upper limb functions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of robots in upper limb disability improvement and rehabilitation. Methods: This scoping review was conducted by search in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEE (January 2012– February 2022). Articles related to upper limb rehabilitation robots were selected. The methodological quality of all the included studies will be appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). We used an 18-field data extraction form to extract data from articles and extracted the information such as study year, country, type of study, purpose, illness or accident leading to disability, level of disability, assistive technologies, number of participants in the study, sex, age, rehabilitated part of the upper limb using a robot, duration and frequency of treatment, methods of performing rehabilitation exercises, type of evaluation, number of participants in the evaluation process, duration of intervention, study outcomes, and study conclusions. The selection of articles and data extraction was made by three authors based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved through consultation with the fifth author. Inclusion criteria were articles involving upper limb rehabilitation robots, articles about upper limb disability caused by any illness or injury, and articles published in English. Also, articles involving other than upper limb rehabilitation robots, robots related to rehabilitation of diseases other than upper limb, systematic reviews, reviews, and meta-analyses, books, book chapters, letters to the editor, and conference papers were also excluded. Descriptive statistics methods (frequency and percentage) were used to analyses the data. Results: We finally included 55 relevant articles. Most of the studies were done in Italy (33.82%). Most robots were used to rehabilitate stroke patients (80%). About 60.52% of the studies used games and virtual reality rehabilitate the upper limb disabilities using robots. Among the 14 types of applied evaluation methods, “evaluation and measurement of upper limb function and dexterity” was the most applied evaluation method. “Improvement in musculoskeletal functions”, “no adverse effect on patients”, and “Safe and reliable treatment” were the most cited outcomes, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings show that robots can improve musculoskeletal functions (musculoskeletal strength, sensation, perception, vibration, muscle coordination, less spasticity, flexibility, and range of motion) and empower people by providing a variety of rehabilitation capabilities. © 2023, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158091727"

However, many teaching resources are in short supply due to a lack of standardized resource construction and the closeness of management methods. Physical education significant teaching resources in Chinese colleges and universities must be utilized. If not integrated, it would seriously restrict the development of physical education in China. However, the traditional management of physical education teaching resources tends to worsen the data management, which is easy to cause the loss of physical education teaching resources data. With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and other technologies, intelligent edge cloud computing can ensure the integrity of physical education teaching resources and improve utilization. In this paper, cloud computing is used to manage physical education teaching resources in colleges and universities, and virtualization technology is used to research physical education teaching resources. Moreover, a resource scheduling method is proposed to ensure equal load distribution across various edge resources. The proposed strategy also provides increased utilization levels for computing resources. The comparison between the sports teaching resources under cloud computing and traditional sports teaching resources found that cloud resource management's sharing degree of teaching equipment has increased by 20.6% compared with conventional resource management. The sharing degree of courses has increased by 16.5%, and the utilization rate of sports venues has increased by 27.1% compared with traditional resource management. The utilization rate of sports film and television materials increased by 30.7%. Teachers and students benefit significantly from college and university teaching resources in the context of cloud computing. It demonstrates how cloud computing may assist colleges and universities in managing and integrating their teaching resources more effectively. The management and integration of college sports resources through cloud computing can promote the mutual exchange of college resources and have practical significance for the development of college education. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160202910"

We are motivated by shedding light on whether the metaverse is just a new marketing buzzword or a new transformative trend. We have identified six areas with key uncertainties, which require agreement and solutions from industry players – the space, the interface, the IT infrastructure, the monetary infrastructure, the digital ID and the energy. These uncertainties will be resolved in a series of cooperative and competitive games among the key stakeholders who will need to work on being aligned on a set of standards. The practical implication is that the metaverse cannot be ignored, but there are non-trivial challenges that need to be resolved first.

Furthermore, there is no evidence of interaction between visual and vestibular signals in autonomic control, as would be expected since they are highly integrated. The present study explored the cardiovascular responses to vestibular and visual stimuli in normal subjects. We hypothesized that the visual stimuli would modify the cardiovascular response to vestibular stimulation, especially when the latter is ambiguous with respect to gravity. Off-Vertical-Axis-Rotation (OVAR) was used to stimulate vestibular and extra-vestibular receptors of gravity in 36 healthy young adults while virtual reality was used for visual stimulation. Arterial pressure (AP), respiratory rate and ECG were measured. The analysis accounted for the respiratory modulation of AP and heart rate (HR). Vestibular stimulation by OVAR was shown to modulate both mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR, while the visual stimulation was significantly affecting HR modulation, but not MAP. Moreover, the specific visual effect was present only when the subjects were not in rotation. Therefore, visual stimulation is able to modulate the heart rate, but is overridden by vestibular stimulation due to real movement. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150230624"

In the current study we used real water to give virtual objects (i.e., animated virtual water) more realistic physical properties (wet liquid qualities). Healthy volunteers aged 18–34 participated in a within-subject randomized study comparing participants’ worst pain during brief thermal stimuli with (1) No Immersive Virtual Reality (VR), versus (2) during VR + no tactile feedback versus (3) VR + real water (with tactile feedback from co-located real objects). Tactile feedback significantly decreased pain intensity (VR analgesia, p < 0.01), compared to VR with no tactile feedback, and compared to No VR (baseline). Tactile feedback made the virtual water feel significantly more real, increased participant’s sense of presence, and both VR conditions were distracting (significantly reduced accuracy on an attention demanding task). As a non-pharmacologic analgesic, mixed reality reduced pain by 35% in the current study, comparable to the analgesia from a moderate dose of hydromorphone in previous published experimental studies.

However not all patients achieve clinically significant weight loss and weight regain is common. In this context, technology-based interventions can be used to enhance traditional CBT but are not yet widespread. This survey therefore explores the status quo of pathways of communication between patients and therapists, the use of digital applications for therapy as well as attitudes towards VR from the perspective of patients with obesity in Germany. Methods: This cross-sectional online survey was conducted in October 2020. Participants were recruited digitally through social media, obesity associations and self-help groups. The standardized questionnaire included items concerning current treatment, paths of communication with their therapists, and attitudes toward VR. The descriptive analyses were performed with Stata. Results: The 152 participants were mostly female (90%), had a mean age of 46.5 years (SD = 9.2) and an average BMI of 43.0 kg/m² (SD = 8.4). Face-to-face communication with their therapist was considered of high importance in current treatment (M = 4.30; SD = 0.86) and messenger apps were the most frequently used digital application for communication. Participants were mostly neutral regarding the inclusion of VR methods in obesity treatment (M = 3.27; SD = 1.19). Only one participant had already used VR glasses as part of treatment. Participants considered VR suitable for exercises promoting body image change (M = 3.40; SD = 1.02). Discussion: Technological approaches in obesity therapy are not widespread. Face-to-face communication remains the most important setting for treatment. Participants had low familiarity with VR but a neutral to positive attitude toward the technology. Further studies are needed to provide a clearer picture of potential treatment barriers or educational needs and to facilitate the transfer of developed VR systems into clinical practice. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160079410"

VR is typically incorporated into the psychotherapeutic process as a means of providing exposure therapy. The objectives of this scoping review were to synthesize the most up-to-date evidence on the outcomes, acceptability, and side effects of VR interventions for treating anxiety disorders in adults. Methods: This scoping review is grounded in the methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley (2005). The databases searched were PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Results: The search process identified 112 unique citations. 52 (46%) of the eligible articles examined participants with specific phobias, 25 (22%) with PTSD, 21 (19%) with social anxiety disorder, 12 (10%) with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, and 3 (3%) with generalized anxiety disorder. VR interventions often led to statistically significant and meaningful reductions in symptoms for people with anxiety disorders. Additionally, they were acceptable to clients and associated with minimal side effects for all types of anxiety disorders, except for Combat-Related PTSD in Vietnam veterans. Limitations: Limitations included the fact that the studies in this review were of varying quality, and that articles in languages other than English and French were excluded. Conclusion: VR interventions appeared to be a viable alternative to conventional exposure therapy. Future research should include more male participants and have a stronger emphasis on acceptability and side effects. Increased traction for VR interventions for generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder is also important. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150338169"

Secondarily, to determine the most recommendable dose of VRBT to improve balance. Methods: PubMed Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL and PEDro were screened, without publication date restrictions, until September 30th, 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of VRBT against other interventions in PwMS were included. Functional and dynamic balance, confidence of balance, postural control in posturography, fear of falling and gait speed were the variables assessed. A meta-analysis was performed by pooling the Cohen's standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.0. Results: Nineteen RCTs, reporting 858 PwMS, were included. Our findings reported that VRBT is effective in improving functional balance (SMD = 0.8; 95%CI 0.47 to 1.14; p < 0.001); dynamic balance (SMD = − 0.3; 95%CI − 0.48 to − 0.11; p = 0.002); postural control with posturography (SMD = − 0.54; 95%CI − 0.99 to − 0.1; p = 0.017); confidence of balance (SMD = 0.43; 95%CI 0.15 to 0.71; p = 0.003); and in reducing fear of falling (SMD = − 1.04; 95%CI − 2 to − 0.07; p = 0.035); but not on gait speed (SMD = − 0.11; 95%CI: − 0.35 to 0.14; p = 0.4). Besides, the most adequate dose of VRBT to achieve the greatest improvement in functional balance was at least 40 sessions, five sessions per week and 40–45 min per sessions; and for dynamic balance, it would be between 8 and 19 weeks, twice a week and 20–30 min per session.

Implemented as systems-identification approaches, they can be used to quantitatively assess balance deficits and separate underlying causes. However, the experiments require controlled perturbations and sophisticated modeling and optimization techniques. Here we propose and validate a virtual reality implementation of moving visual scene experiments together with model-based interpretations of the results. The approach simplifies the experimental implementation and offers a platform to implement standardized analysis routines. Sway of 14 healthy young subjects wearing a virtual reality head-mounted display was measured. Subjects viewed a virtual room or a screen inside the room, which were both moved during a series of sinusoidal or pseudo-random room or screen tilt sequences recorded on two days. In a between-subject comparison of 10 × 6 min long pseudo-random sequences, each applied at 5 amplitudes, our results showed no difference to a real-world moving screen experiment from the literature. We used the independent-channel model to interpret our data, which provides a direct estimate of the visual contribution to balance, together with parameters characterizing the dynamics of the feedback system. Reliability estimates of single subject parameters from six repetitions of a 6 × 20-s pseudo-random sequence showed poor test–retest agreement. Estimated parameters show excellent reliability when averaging across three repetitions within each day and comparing across days (Intra-class correlation; ICC 0.7–0.9 for visual weight, time delay and feedback gain). Sway responses strongly depended on the visual scene, where the high-contrast, abstract screen evoked larger sway as compared to the photo-realistic room. In conclusion, our proposed virtual reality approach allows researchers to reliably assess balance control dynamics including the visual contribution to balance with minimal implementation effort. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148111313"

All PD patients underwent 24 sessions of Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment training. The participants were assessed at baseline (T0) and after two months (T1). Our results suggested that Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment training may be effective in the cognitive and emotional domains, particularly by improving executive function, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. These changes have helped to improve self-efficacy and coping strategies. These results indicate greater cognitive and physical effort to overcome stressors. Our results show that Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment training was beneficial in improving cognitive functions.

This review elaborated on simulation training for intracranial aneurysm clipping. Methods: A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines to identify studies on aneurysm clipping training using models and simulators. The primary outcome was the identification of the predominant modes of the simulation process, models, and training methods associated with a microsurgical learning curve. The secondary outcomes included assessments of the validation of such simulators and the learning capability from the use of such simulators. Results: Of the 2068 articles screened, 26 studies met the inclusion criteria. The chosen reports used a wide range of simulation approaches including ex vivo methods (n = 6); virtual reality (VR) platforms (n = 11); and static (n = 6) and dynamic (n = 3) 3D-printed aneurysm models (n = 6). The ex vivo training methods have limited availability, VR simulators lack haptics and tactility, while 3D static models lack important microanatomical components and the simulation of blood flow. 3D dynamic models including pulsatile flow are reusable and cost-effective but miss microanatomical components. Conclusions: The existing training methods are heterogenous and do not realistically simulate the complete microsurgical workflow. The current simulations lack certain anatomical features and crucial surgical steps. Future research should focus on developing and validating a reusable, cost-effective training platform. No systematic validation method exists for the different training models, so there is a need to build homogenous assessment tools and validate the role of simulation in education and patient safety. © 2023, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158029958"

Concussion can result in post-injury vestibular and balance impairments that can present up to five years post initial concussion event, ultimately affecting many daily and functional activities. While current clinical treatment aims to reduce symptoms, the developing use of technology in everyday life has seen the emergence of virtual reality. Current literature has failed to identify substantial evidence regarding the use of virtual reality in rehabilitation. The primary aim of this scoping review is to identify, synthesise, and assess the quality of studies reporting on the effectiveness of virtual reality for the rehabilitation of vestibular and balance impairments post-concussion. Additionally, this review aims to summarise the volume of scientific literature and identify the knowledge gaps in current research pertaining to this topic. Methods: A scoping review of six databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, ProQuest, SportDiscus, Scopus) and a grey literature (Google Scholar) was conducted using three key concepts (virtual reality, vestibular symptoms, and post-concussion). Data was charted from studies and outcomes were categorised into one of three categories: (1) balance; (2) gait; or (3) functional outcome measures. Critical appraisal of each study was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. A critical appraisal of each outcome measure was also completed utilising a modified GRADE appraisal tool to summarise the quality of evidence. Effectiveness was assessed using calculations of change in performance and change per exposure time. Results: Three randomised controlled trials, three quasi-experimental studies, three case studies, and one retrospective cohort study were ultimately included, using a thorough eligibility criteria. All studies were inclusive of different virtual reality interventions. The ten studies had a 10-year range and identified 19 different outcome measures. Conclusion: The findings from this review suggests that virtual reality is an effective tool for the rehabilitation of vestibular and balance impairments post-concussion. Current literature shows sufficient but low level of evidence, and more research is necessary to develop a quantitative standard and to better understand appropriate dosage of virtual reality intervention. © 2023, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149495789"

It is imperative to understand how construction practitioners perceive technology integration in construction planning in light of emerging technologies. This study intended to uncover unique experimental findings by integrating 4D-building information modelling (BIM) to virtual reality (VR) technology during construction planning among construction professionals at light steel framing (LSF) projects. Design/methodology/approach: The building industry participants were invited to provide inputs on two different construction planning methods: conventional and innovative methods. The conventional method involved the participants using traditional platforms such as 2D computer-aided design (CAD) and physical visualisation of paper-based construction drawings for the LSF assembly process with a Gantt Chart tool to complete construction planning-related tasks for the targeted project. Comparatively, participants are required to perform the same tasks using more innovative platforms like 4D-BIM in a VR environment. Findings: A Charrette Test Method was used to validate the findings, highlighting an improvement in usability (+10.3%), accuracy (+89.1%) and speed (+30%) using 4D BIM with VR compared to the conventional paper-based method. The findings are also validated by a paired t-test, which is supported by the rationality of the same findings. This study posits positive results for construction planning through the utilisation of modern practices and technologies. These findings are significant for the global construction industry facing low productivity issues, delays and certainty in terms of building delivery timelines due to poor construction planning. Originality/value: This new blend of technologies—combining 4D BIM and VR in industrialised construction projects—potentially directs future initiatives to drive the efficiency of construction planning in the building lifecycle. The interactive BIM-based virtual environment would purposefully transform construction planning practices in order to deliver modern and more certain building construction methods with a focus on prefabrication processes. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139224084"

We found that rats can efficiently navigate or direct objects to arbitrary goal locations within a virtual reality arena solely by activating and sustaining appropriate hippocampal representations of remote places.

Yet, there is evidence that perceived distance is more accurate in modern compared to older head-mounted displays (HMDs). This meta-analysis, based on 137 samples from 61 publications, describes egocentric distance perception across 20 HMDs and examines the relationship between perceived distance and technical HMD characteristics. Judged distance was positively associated with HMD field of view (FOV), positively associated with HMD resolution, and negatively associated with HMD weight. The effects of FOV and resolution were more pronounced among heavier HMDs. These findings suggest that future improvements in these technical characteristics may be central to resolving the problem of distance underperception in VR.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135754044"

Here, ZnO–Co3O4−v nanozymes with several surfaces and bulk oxygen vacancies were created. The O atoms of H2O2 moved inward to preferentially fill the oxygen vacancies in the interior and form new “lattice oxygen” by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth analysis and X-ray absorption fine structure. The internal Co2+ continually transferred electrons to the surface for a continuous catalytic reaction, which generated a significant amount of reactive oxygen species. Inner and outer double-layer electron cycles accompanied this process. A three-dimensional model of ZnO–Co3O4−v was constructed using virtual reality interactive modelling technology to illustrate nanozyme catalysis. Moreover, the bactericidal rate of ZnO–Co3O4−v for Methionine-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Multiple drug resistant Escherichia coli was as high as 99%. ZnO–Co3O4−v was biocompatible and might be utilized to heal wounds following Methionine-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.

Its major limitation, as with any quantitative phase imaging approach, is the lack of specificity compared to fluorescence microscopy, thus restraining its huge potentialities in single-cell analysis and diagnostics. Remarkable results in introducing specificity are obtained through artificial intelligence (AI), but only for adherent cells. However, accessing the 3D fluorescence ground truth and obtaining accurate voxel-level co-registration of image pairs for AI training is not viable for high-throughput cytometry. The recent statistical inference approach is a significant step forward for label-free specificity but remains limited to cells’ nuclei. Here, a generalized computational strategy based on a self-consistent statistical inference to achieve intracellular multi-specificity is shown. Various subcellular compartments (i.e., nuclei, cytoplasmic vacuoles, the peri-vacuolar membrane area, cytoplasm, vacuole-nucleus contact site) can be identified and characterized quantitatively at different phases of the cells life cycle by using yeast cells as a biological model. Moreover, for the first time, virtual reality is introduced for handling the information content of multi-specificity in single cells. Full fruition is proofed for exploring and interacting with 3D quantitative biophysical parameters of the identified compartments on demand, thus opening the route to a metaverse for 3D microscopy. © 2023 The Authors.

This avoids privacy concerns arising from nudity or minimal clothing. Specifically, we propose a novel two-stage framework with a Semantic-guided Undressing Network (SUNet) and an Intra-Inter Transformer Network (IITNet). SUNet learns semantically related body features to alleviate the complexity and uncertainty of directly estimating 3D inner-bodies under clothing. IITNet reconstructs the 3D inner-body model by making full use of intra-frame and inter-frame information, which addresses the misalignment of inconsistent poses in different frames.

Across a desktop monitor and a head-mounted display (HMD), we assessed scatterplot designs which vary their use of visual cues - motion, shading, perspective (graphical projection), and dimensionality - on two sets of data. We conducted a user study with a summary task in which 32 participants estimated the classification accuracy of an artificial neural network from the scatterplots. With Bayesian multilevel modeling, we capture the intricate visual effects and find that no cue alone explains all the variance in estimation error. Visual motion cues generally reduce participants' estimation error; besides this motion, using other cues may increase participants' estimation error. Using an HMD, adding visual motion cues, providing a third data dimension, or showing a more complicated dataset leads to longer response times. We speculate that most visual cues may not strongly affect perception in immersive analytics unless they change people's mental model about data. In summary, by studying participants as they interpret the output from a complicated machine learning model, we advance our understanding of how to use the visual cues in immersive analytics.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135222932"

The model fits seven parameters reflecting the encoding, calculation, and production errors associated with inaccuracies in PI. We compared these parameters across younger and older participants and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), including those with (MCI+) and without (MCI−) cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD neuropathology. MCI patients showed overestimation of the angular turn in the outbound path and more variable inbound distances and directions compared with healthy elderly.

The use of virtual reality (VR) devices during flexible bronchoscopy (FB) as a method of distraction to increase patient tolerability and improve satisfaction has not been investigated. We aim to assess the satisfaction and tolerability of participants undergoing FB with or without VR. Methods: This was a single-center, open-label study on patients undergoing bronchoscopy, randomized into the control and interventional (VR) groups. The control group received standard care during FB. The interventional group was given a VR device during FB showing nature videos with soothing instrumental music. Pain, breathlessness, and cough were evaluated using a 10 cm visual analogue scale administered before and after FB. Anxiety was assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Satisfaction questionnaire (5-point Likert scale) was given to participants post FB. Results: Eighty participants enrolled, 40 in each arm. Median (IQR) satisfaction score in the VR group was 5.0 (3.0–5.0), and in the control group was 4.0 (3.0–5.0); (p < 0.001). Breathlessness, cough, and anxiety post FB were significantly less severe in the interventional group (p = 0.042, p = 0.001, p < 0.001), but the pain was not significantly different (p = 0.290). Conclusion: VR used during FB led to better participants' satisfaction and tolerability (breathlessness and cough).

For this reason, many countries have developed policies and rating systems for converting current buildings to more energy-efficient and sustainable ones. However, religious buildings such as mosques were given little attention. Mosques are considered one of the unique building types for their operational scheme, and occupancy pattern throughout the year differ from any other types of buildings. Many factors affect mosques’ operational performance, such as energy wastage from their intermittent operation, poor building envelope characteristics, excessive lighting and HVAC systems, and poor thermal and visual comfort for the occupants. This paper presents a framework that aids in assessing and enhancing the operational performance of mosque buildings using five main evaluation criteria. The development of the framework involves four main stages. The first stage involves data acquisition using 3D laser scanning for electronic building documentation and site investigation that identifies the main factors affecting mosques’ operational performance. The second stage involves constructing the BIM model for developing the energy analysis model using IESVE (Integrated Environmental Solutions-Virtual Environment) software. Then, the third stage considers proposing different retrofit strategies that could be applied to evaluate their impact on the mosques’ operational performance.

This paper addresses three research questions: Is the metaverse an appropriate platform for teaching Lean? What are the benefits and problems of this approach over traditional classroom methods? What are the future implications for teaching Lean in the VR-enabled metaverse? Design/methodology/approach: The research presented in this paper is exploratory. A critical realism approach is adopted using action research through the preparation, delivery and review of the first four masterclasses entitled Leading Intelligent Lean offered by Gemba (formerly The Leadership Network). The data collection methods included a pre-workshop questionnaire, participant observation, focus groups and end-of-course surveys. Findings: It was found that Lean can be taught successfully in the metaverse. There are many related benefits, particularly in terms of the high levels of immersion and the “wow” factor. Remaining technological limitations are reduced by continually improving the metaverse platform and the course content and delivery. The authors conclude that the metaverse is a useful addition to teaching Lean – and is especially promising when used in a blended teaching approach. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of teaching Lean in a VR-enabled metaverse and one of the first of teaching and learning in the metaverse regardless of topic. The respective problems and benefits of this approach versus teaching in a traditional classroom setting are discussed. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138191429"

This paper aims to provide reliable support for future in-depth research on kinesiophobia through scientometrics and historical review. Studies on kinesiophobia published from 2002 to 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to conduct bibliometric analysis of the included studies and map knowledge domains. Keywords were manually clustered, and the results were analyzed and summarized in combination with a literature review. A total of 4157 original research articles and reviews were included. Research on kinesiophobia is developing steadily and has received more attention from scholars in recent years. There are regional differences in the distribution of research. Chronic pain is the focus of research in this field. A multidisciplinary model of pain neuroscience education combined with physical therapy based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and the introduction and development of virtual reality may be the frontier of research. There is a large space for the study of kinesiophobia. In the future, to improve regional academic exchanges and cooperation, more attention should be given to the clinical applicability and translation of scientific work, which will be conducive to improving the quality of life and physical and mental health outcomes of kinesiophobia patients.

The primary issue with image warping is disocclusions, where occluded (and hence unknown) parts of the input image would be required to compose the output image. We introduce a new image warping method, Metameric image inpainting - an approach for hole-filling in real-time with foundations in human visual perception. Our method estimates image feature statistics of disoccluded regions from their neighbours. These statistics are inpainted and used to synthesise visuals in real-time that are less noticeable to study participants, particularly in peripheral vision. Our method offers speed improvements over the standard structured image inpainting methods while improving realism over colour-based inpainting such as push-pull. Hence, our work paves the way towards future applications such as depth image-based rendering, 6-DoF 360 rendering, and remote render-streaming.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141479866"

Empirical data were collected through interviews, a survey, and a test on secondary school student performance in Rwanda. The findings reveal four main forms of participating in knowledge construction with computer simulations: self-reliance, peer collaboration-reliance, teacher-guided-reliance, and strategic variation-reliance. The study found no statistical difference between male and female students’ preferences while engaging with these forms. There was also no difference in their performance in terms of higher order thinking skills in chemistry learning with computer simulations. Moreover, the findings demonstrated that computer simulations can help students to create multisensory connections enabling them to become actively engaged in chemistry learning through various settings. Consequently, the lines between abstract concepts and their related chemical reactions and processes become closely connected in a virtual reality. Finally, this study suggests a pedagogical strategy that teachers can undertake to support student active engagement in chemistry learning with computer simulations. © 2023, Commonwealth of Learning.

Gold bulk and hollow nanowires show distinctive electrical properties with high chemical stability and high stretchability. In accordance, the monolithically patterned gold nanowires can be used to fabricate the robust interfaces, programmable sensors, on-demand heating systems, and strain-gated logical circuits. The stretchable sensors show high sensitivity for strain and temperature changes on the skin. Furthermore, the micro-wrinkle structures of gold nanowires exhibit the negative gauge factor, which can be used for strain-gated logical circuits.

Efforts are underway to develop advanced cartridges for next-generation gas respirators in civil-military combined use to improve wearability and protection for users (firefighters, military personnel, and environmental and safety-related workers). Herein, the performance of three newly designed cartridges for a next-generation gas respirator was evaluated using flow analysis, along with adsorption characteristics. The adsorption kinetics of cyclohexane gas on ASC (a copper-silver-hexavalent chromium impregnated activated carbon in the study) was measured by breakthrough experiments in a packed bed, and the obtained parameters were used in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for the designed plate-type cartridges. To apply the physical properties of the adsorbent to the CFD simulation, porous materials were expressed using the granular technique and packed bed technique. The CFD model was verified through a gas adsorption experiment using a prototype cartridge. The respiration resistance and breakthrough time for the filled-adsorbent efficiency and lifespan were compared among the three designed cartridges according to the gas inflow conditions. Additionally, virtual engineering was performed by grafting the CFD results to a virtual reality (VR) system with which 3-dimensional performance visuals of the cartridges could be observed. The developed VR system provides detailed information for cartridge design and optimization. Overall, the developed procedure of virtual engineering can be used to improve CFD simulation results. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173218943"

Yet, traditionally, visual search is investigated in tightly controlled paradigms, where head-restricted participants locate a minimalistic target in a cluttered array that is presented on a computer screen. Do traditional visual search tasks predict performance in naturalistic settings, where participants actively explore complex, real-world scenes? Here, we leverage advances in virtual reality technology to test the degree to which classic and naturalistic search are limited by a common factor, set size, and the degree to which individual differences in classic search behavior predict naturalistic search behavior in a large sample of individuals (N = 75). In a naturalistic search task, participants looked for an object within their environment via a combination of head-turns and eye-movements using a head-mounted display. Then, in a classic search task, participants searched for a target within a simple array of colored letters using only eye-movements. In each task, we found that participants’ search performance was impacted by increases in set size—the number of items in the visual display. Critically, we observed that participants’ efficiency in classic search tasks—the degree to which set size slowed performance—indeed predicted efficiency in real-world scenes. These results demonstrate that classic, computer-based visual search tasks are excellent models of active, real-world search behavior. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146194993"

In our work, we build upon an existing immersive analytic system - Immersive Space to Think, to evaluate how immersive analytic systems can support sensemaking tasks over time. We conducted a user study with eight participants with three separate analysis sessions each. We found significant differences between analysis strategies between sessions one, two, and three, which suggest that immersive space to think can benefit analysts during multiple stages in the sensemaking process.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139408064"

Based on scientific analyses and simulation experiments, exterior colours and textures were virtually restored by combining 3D scanning and multi-view 3D reconstruction. At the same time, an efficient cultural relics high-fidelity information 3D modelling method was proposed. Colours and textures are essential for polychrome cultural relics, reflecting the historical appearance and technology. Due to long periods of natural ageing and the destruction of environmental factors, the colours and textures of polychrome sculptures are often altered or radically changed, making it difficult for people to appreciate the initial appearance. With the rapid development of digital technology and high-fidelity 3D modelling, virtual reality technology allows us to restore the appearance of cultural relics. This study expands the dimension of cultural relics exhibition, provides new perspectives for archaeology, art history and cultural heritage research, and provides a reference for the virtual restoration and digitalised archive of other cultural relics. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146511335"

We introduce a new sketch-based system, CreatureShop, that enables amateurs to create high-quality textured 3D character models from 2D drawings with ease and efficiency. CreatureShop takes an input bitmap drawing of a character (such as an animal or other creature), depicted from an arbitrary descriptive pose and viewpoint, and creates a 3D shape with plausible geometric details and textures from a small number of user annotations on the 2D drawing. Our key contributions are a novel oblique view modeling method, a set of systematic approaches for producing plausible textures on the invisible or occluded parts of the 3D character (as viewed from the direction of the input drawing), and a user-friendly interactive system. We validate our system and methods by creating numerous 3D characters from various drawings, and compare our results with related works to show the advantages of our method. We perform a user study to evaluate the usability of our system, which demonstrates that our system is a practical and efficient approach to create fully-textured 3D character models for novice users.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136075814"

Studying these processes involves the intellectual challenge of cutting across traditional neuroscience silos, and the technical challenge of recording data in uncontrolled natural environments. However, recent advances in techniques, such as neuroimaging, virtual reality, and motion tracking, allow one to address these issues in naturalistic environments for both healthy participants and clinical populations. In this review, we survey six topics in which naturalistic approaches have advanced both our fundamental understanding of brain function and how neurologic deficits influence goal-directed, coordinated action in naturalistic environments. The first part conveys fundamental neuroscience mechanisms related to visuospatial coding for action, adaptive eye-hand coordination, and visuomotor integration for manual interception. The second part discusses applications of such knowledge to neurologic deficits, specifically, steering in the presence of cortical blindness, impact of stroke on visual-proprioceptive integration, and impact of visual search and working memory deficits. This translational approach—extending knowledge from lab to rehab—provides new insights into the complex interplay between perceptual, motor, and cognitive control in naturalistic tasks that are relevant for both basic and clinical research.

To clarify which modality richness online retailers use is more appropriate to create a virtual reality simulation experience to fill a significant gap in the sensory interactive marketing paradigm. Design/methodology/approach: A task-based laboratory study was conducted to provide users with private try-on space. A total of 429 valid questionnaires were collected, and partial least squares path modeling was adopted to test hypotheses. Findings: The results indicate that various levels of modality richness (text-visual, audiovisual and ARIT) positively affect vivid memories (visual sensory detailed, emotionally intense, first-person perspective and coherent), and vivid memories successfully induce exploratory behavior. Practical implications: The study results could also help retailers and brands with clear guidance in designing and creating simulation experience services and choosing the best way to present products. With the results of this research, retailers will also be able to grasp better the critical points of introducing innovative technology into the service experience and then create the benefits of digital economic growth.

A qualitative approach was employed for data collection to enable a detailed exploration. Two data collection instruments were used in the experiment: a virtual synchronous focus group and an open-ended question. One hundred twenty-one students participated in 13 virtual focus groups, and 124 students responded to the open-ended questions. Thematic analysis was used to analyse data, and as a result, 26 factors were identified as antecedents to the acceptance of 3DVW in higher education. Those factors are then classified into 12 categories based on their definition and similarities. Twenty-one out of the 26 factors impact the user acceptance of 3DVW positively, and five factors impact it negatively.

Namely, it can generate the reference tracking signal for each follower. Furthermore, since only the output of each follower is available and its dynamics is inevitably disturbed by diverse uncertainties and disturbances, a prescribed-time extended state observer is developed for estimation. In addition, a robust prescribed-time containment controller is put forward to realize the containment control. Then the proposed strategy is successfully applied to the wheeled mobile robots.

As discussed in the work of Laland, social learning is a technique used by all animals and humans to learn from the environment. The new generation of students is raised in a world of information and communication technology. The wealth of knowledge is at their disposal in the form of the Internet. As a result, facilitating social learning is the primary consideration in the design of learning systems. The new social learning systems must assist the learner rather than teach him. The three key functions required are (1) assist in locating the appropriate content; (2) assist learners in connecting with the appropriate people; and (3) motivate/incentivize people to learn. Augmented reality/ virtual reality (VR) can be used to improve social learning among people. The interaction of people with a simulated environment made using computer technology, typically including computer graphics and artificial intelligence, is known as virtual reality. Virtual is something that does not exist in reality. In VR, a person can hold animated or virtual items created using computer graphics and artificial intelligence. This chapter discusses several VR applications for social learning. These applications are in the metaverse, social media, neuropathy and psychology, training, and distance education fields. Each application is covered with references to the most recent research in the field. Additionally highlighted are the social and ethical concerns with using VR for social learning.

Therefore, the present study aims to explore practitioners' perceptions of VR training in elite football and baseball, with a focus on the important factors, obstacles, perceived knowledge and practical use of the technology. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach measuring practitioner perceptions via an online questionnaire was adopted. Football respondents (n = 25) represented practitioners from major football leagues across the world, and baseball respondents (n = 15) represented practitioners from Major League Baseball. Findings: Both football and baseball respondents reported that the most important factor for implementation of VR training was improvement in on-field performance (technical and tactical); whilst cost was viewed as the biggest obstacle. Both football and baseball respondents also noted that the most likely group to receive VR training would be injured and rehabilitating athletes. Mann–Whitney U tests revealed that football respondents perceived coach (p = 0.02) and executive approval (p < 0.001) as significantly greater obstacles than baseball respondents. Originality/value: This research provides novel and invaluable information for stakeholders within VR regarding what the elite organisations of different sports perceive as the most important factors for implementation, as well as greatest obstacles preventing use. This information should guide future development and marketing of VR training systems in sport. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175986504"

Design/methodology/approach: A multicriteria comparative study was conducted with 26 university students using the “analytic hierarchy process” technique to compare the three approaches applied to home finishing material selection tasks based on the five “service convenience” dimensions, consisting of access convenience, decision convenience, transaction convenience, benefit convenience and post-benefit convenience. Findings: The results indicated that the “Cloud-based VR Approach” was perceived to be more convenient than the “3D Model Approach” and the “Image Approach” based on the aspects of “decision convenience”, “transaction convenience”, “benefit convenience” and “post-benefit convenience”. The only aspect that the Cloud-based VR Approach was comparatively less convenient than the 3D Model Approach and Image Approach for the user was “access convenience”. Overall, the findings showed that the developed Cloud-based VR Approach had more potential than the conventional approaches in aiding the design evaluation process under ongoing social distancing measures requiring designers and clients to work remotely. Originality/value: The disastrous impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on logistical systems have resulted in massive disruptions to the construction industry worldwide. Various construction activities have been halted and most meetings moved online.

This is particularly important in the combat casualty care setting when a single casualty may be treated by four or more or five completely disparate teams across the roles of care. The Battlefield Assisted Trauma Distributed Observation Kit (BATDOK) is a digital battlefield clinical documentation system developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory to address this need. To support the deployment of this tool, we integrated BATDOK into a commercially available virtual reality (VR) medical simulation platform used by the U.S. Air Force and Defense Health Agency personnel in order to provide an immersive simulation training experience which included battlefield documentation. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team consisting of medical educators, VR simulation engineers, emergency physicians and pararescuemen, and BATDOK developers first developed a specification for a virtual BATDOK capability, including a detailed listing of learning objectives, critical interfaces and task plans, and sensor integrations. These specifications were then implemented into the commercially available Virtual Advancement of Learning for Operational Readiness VR Medical Simulation System and underwent developmental testing and evaluation during pararescueman training exercises at the Air Force Special Operations Command Special Operations Center for Medical Integration and Development. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The BATDOK capability was successfully implemented within the VR Medical Simulation System. The capability consisted of a virtual tablet with replicated interfaces and capabilities based on the developed specifications. These capabilities included integrated point-of-care ultrasound capability, multi-patient management, vitals sign monitoring with sensor pairing and continuous monitoring, mechanism of injury documentation (including injury pattern documentation), intervention logging (including tourniquets, dressing, airways, lines, tubes and drains, splints, fluids, and medications), and event logging. The capability was found to be operational and in alignment with learning objectives and user acceptance goals. © The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2023. All rights reserved.

Without much leeway for cognitive or motor errors, this poses a formidable computational problem. Utilizing fully immersive virtual reality with 13 natural threats, we examined escape decisions in N = 59 humans. We show that escape goals are dynamically updated according to environmental changes. The decision whether and when to escape depends on time-to-impact, threat identity and predicted trajectory, and stable personal characteristics. Its implementation appears to integrate secondary goals such as behavioral affordances. Perturbance experiments show that the underlying decision algorithm exhibits planning properties and can integrate novel actions. In contrast, rapid information-seeking and foraging-suppression are only partly devaluation-sensitive. Instead of being instinctive or hardwired stimulus-response patterns, human escape decisions integrate multiple variables in a flexible computational architecture.

However, movement can produce major artifacts that affect EDA signals, especially in uncontrolled environments where users can freely walk and move their hands. This work develops a fully automatic pipeline for recognizing and correcting motion EDA artifacts, exploring the suitability of long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). First, we constructed the EDABE dataset, collecting 74h EDA signals from 43 subjects collected during an immersive virtual reality task and manually corrected by two experts to provide a ground truth. The LSTM-1D CNN model produces the best performance recognizing 72% of artifacts with 88% accuracy, outperforming two state-of-the-art methods in sensitivity, AUC and kappa, in the test set. Subsequently, we developed a polynomial regression model to correct the detected artifacts automatically. Evaluation of the complete pipeline demonstrates that the automatically and manually corrected signals do not present differences in the phasic components, supporting their use in place of expert manual correction. In addition, the EDABE dataset represents the first public benchmark to compare the performance of EDA correction models. This work provides a pipeline to automatically correct EDA artifacts that can be used in uncontrolled conditions. This tool will allow to development of intelligent devices that recognize human emotional states without human intervention. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161275552"

The processing of salient events is associated with dopamine release, the balance of which is altered in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Errors in observed actions trigger various electrocortical indices (e.g. mid-frontal theta, error-related delta, and error positivity [oPe]). However, the impact of dopamine depletion to observed errors in the same individual remains unclear. Healthy controls (HCs) and PD patients observed ecological reach-to-grasp-a-glass actions performed by a virtual arm from a first-person perspective. PD patients were tested under their dopaminergic medication (on-condition) and after dopaminergic withdrawal (off-condition). Analyses of oPe, delta, and theta-power increases indicate that while the formers were elicited after incorrect vs. correct actions in all groups, the latter were observed in on-condition but altered in off-condition PD. Therefore, different EEG error signatures may index the activity of distinct mechanisms, and error-related theta power is selectively modulated by dopamine depletion. Our findings may facilitate discovering dopamine-related biomarkers for error-monitoring dysfunctions that may have crucial theoretical and clinical implications. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146301480"

However, limited availability of reliable data can hamper the accuracy of CW effluent predictions, thus increasing design costs and time. In this study, a novel effluent prediction framework for CWs is proposed, utilizing data dimensionality reduction and virtual sample generation. By using four the machine learning algorithms (Cubist, random forest, support vector regression, and extreme learning machine), important features of CW design are identified and used to build prediction models. The extreme learning machine algorithm achieved the highest determination coefficient and lowest error, identifying it as the most suitable algorithm for effluent prediction. A multi-distribution mega-trend-diffusion algorithm with particle swarm optimization was employed to generate virtual samples. These virtual samples were then combined with real samples to retrain the prediction model and verify the optimization effect. Comparative analysis demonstrated that the integration of virtual samples significantly improved the prediction accuracy for ammonium and chemical oxygen demand. The root mean square error decreased by averages of 60.5% and 42.1%, respectively, and the mean absolute percentage error by averages of 21.5% and 23.8%, respectively. Finally, a CW design process is proposed based on prediction models and virtual samples. This integrated forward prediction and reverse design tool can efficiently support CW design when sample sizes are limited, ultimately leading to more accurate and cost-effective design solutions. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170642806"

In the construction industry, studies have been conducted on the realisation of VR scenarios for construction operations, but the challenges lie in procedural scenario creation based on the knowledge and digital data of the construction project. The purpose of this paper is to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach: A new system and interface allowing an automatic generation of a VR scenario for operating procedure (OP) based on 4D Building Information Modelling (BIM) and tasks authoring by the domain experts are presented. The first process, Automatic Scenario Generation, generates assembly tasks based on the BIM metadata. The second process, Expert Scene and Scenario Authoring, allows adding tasks that cannot be modeled in the BIM OP. Findings: With the 4D BIM methodology, the 3D model of building as well as the 3D OPs contain a time dimension representing the construction phases or planning. The evolution in time of the construction site and the tools and procedures adapted to each construction project must be integrated in the VR simulations. Moreover, domain experts should have control over the scenario and should be able to author tasks assigned to the operator in training. Originality/value: A Unified Modeling Language based framework allows the reuse of BIM metadata to create the scene, VR interactions and the assembly procedure; the assembly procedure is embedded in the virtual environment considering the time (4D) in the construction of the building and is used as a training scenario for the operator; and the training scenario can be refined by adding operational knowledge, such as quality. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137722643"

The outcomes of studies providing artificial sensory feedback are often influenced by the availability of incidental feedback. When subjects are blindfolded and disconnected from the prosthesis, artificial sensory feedback consistently improves control; however, when subjects wear a prosthesis and can see the task, benefits often deteriorate or become inconsistent. We theorize that providing artificial sensory feedback about prosthesis speed, which cannot be precisely estimated via vision, will improve the learning and control of a myoelectric prosthesis. Methods: In this study, we test a joint-speed feedback system with six transradial amputee subjects to evaluate how it affects myoelectric control and adaptation behavior during a virtual reaching task. Results: Our results showed that joint-speed feedback lowered reaching errors and compensatory movements during steady-state reaches. However, the same feedback provided no improvement when control was perturbed. Conclusions: These outcomes suggest that the benefit of joint speed feedback may be dependent on the complexity of the myoelectric control and the context of the task. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146537691"

Here, to provide both comfort and diverse tactile feedback, an easy-to-wear and multimodal wearable haptic auxetic fabric (WHAF) is prepared by knotting shape-memory alloy wires into an auxetic-structured fabric. This unique meta-design allows the WHAF to completely expand and contract in 3D, providing superior size-fitting and shape-fitting capabilities.

However, it is still challenging to haptically simulate the real-world walking experience in different fluid mediums. To tackle this problem, we present PropelWalker, a pair of calf-worn haptic devices for simulating the buoyancy and the resistant force when the human's lower limbs are interacting with different fluids and materials in VR. By using four ducted fans, two installed on each calf, the system can control the strength and the direction of the airflow in real time to provide different levels of force. Our technical evaluation shows that PropelWalker can generate vertical forces up to 27N in two directions (i.e., upward and downward) within 0.85 seconds. Furthermore, the system can stably maintain the generated force with minor turbulence. We further conducted three user-perception studies to understand the capability of PropelWalker to generate distinguishable force stimuli. First, we conducted the just-noticeable-difference (JND) experiments to investigate the threshold of the human perception of on-leg air-flow force feedback. Our second perception study showed that users could distinguish four PropelWalker-generated force levels for simulating different walking mediums (i.e., dry ground, water, mud, and sand), with an average accuracy of 94.2%.

This is not possible without planning for education and related knowledge transfer. On the other hand, disruptive technologies such as virtual reality (VR) have revolutionized the field of education. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of holding traditional training courses and VR-based training courses on sustainable behavior. Design/methodology/approach: It is a quasi-experimental study, in which pretest-posttest design and control group are used. The statistical population includes students of one of the Iranian universities. A total of 105 students were randomly divided into two experimental groups and one control group (35 students in each group). Experimental group 1 underwent a training course using VR and Experimental group 2 received a traditional training course. At first, a pre-test was performed and after completing the eight-session period (two 1-h sessions per week), the post-test was conducted again for the groups. Findings: The results of analysis of variance test show that there was a significant difference between the mean scores of sustainable behaviors in the post-test phase in the two experimental groups and the control group. Using Tukey’s test, it was found that the scores of sustainable behavior were different among three groups in pairs. That is, holding a training course as well as using VR has been effective on sustainable behavior.

In this chapter we discuss the impact of Li-Fi over Wi-Fi in the coming days and also how Li-Fi can use the features or the applications of AR/VR to make commutation faster and easier. Li-Fi has so many benefits compared to Wi-Fi, but it has some certain disadvantages too. To achieve a high data rate and meet the smart cities requirement, Li-Fi is the best solution. Li-Fi can accommodate a huge number of users that are needed to connect everything to the so-called Internet of things (IoT). Li-Fi consumes less energy compared to Wi-Fi and has a high-speed transmission rate. It is a bidirectional wireless system that transmits data via LED or infrared light. If the Li-Fi can be used in the field of AR/VR, then this will be a revolution in science and technology.

External cueing, including visual (e.g., spaced lines on the floor) and auditory (e.g., rhythmic metronome beats) stimuli, are considered effective in alleviating mobility deficits and FOG. Currently, there is a need for a technology that delivers automatic, individually adjusted cues in the homes of PwP. The aims of this feasibility study were to describe the first step toward the development of a home-based technology that delivers external cues, test its effect on gait, and assess user experience. Methods: Iterative system development was performed by our multidisciplinary team. The system was designed to deliver visual and auditory cues: light stripes projected on the floor and metronome beats, separately. Initial testing was performed using the feedback of five healthy elderly individuals on the cues’ clarity (clear visibility of the light stripes and the sound of metronome beats) and discomfort experienced. A pilot study was subsequently conducted in the homes of 15 PwP with daily FOG. We measured participants' walking under three conditions: baseline (with no cues), walking with light stripes, and walking to metronome beats. Outcome measures included step length and step time. User experience was also captured in semi-structured interviews. Results: Repeated-measures ANOVA of gait assessment in PwP revealed that light stripes significantly improved step length (p = 0.009) and step time (p = 0.019) of PwP. No significant changes were measured in the metronome condition. PwP reported that both cueing modalities improved their gait, confidence, and stability. Most PwP did not report any discomfort in either modality and expressed a desire to have such a technology in their homes. The metronome was preferred by the majority of participants. Conclusions: This feasibility study demonstrated the usability and potential effect of a novel cueing technology on gait, and represents an important first step toward the development of a technology aimed to prevent FOG by delivering individually adjusted cues automatically. A further full-scale study is needed.

This research aimed to study the life experience of boredom towards online activities leading to dysfunctional behaviours of teens, to survey the preference for online learning methods of Thai adolescent students, and to create a virtual reality classroom for English writing classes. The first study, transcendental phenomenology, included ten teens between 13 and 18 years old selected by purposive sampling. In study, 285 Thai teens were recruited to answer the questionnaire, and the last phase included five experts to discuss the strategies for creating a VR classroom. The research findings indicated that most adolescent students experiencing boredom with online activities defined “boredom” in two ways: blackout and refuelling. The experiences of boredom during COVID-19 led to dysfunctional behaviours such as cheating, aggression, and procrastination. The essence appeared to be two conterminous elements: boredom towards “contents” and “forms”. The survey research findings indicated that almost 50% of the respondents preferred online learning in the form of virtual reality. The researcher, hence, created a four-station-learning VR classroom for English writing class, considering four elements: contents and learning activities, environmental design, multimedia invention, and online platform. All discoveries can be applied to many fields, such as behavioural science, psychology, education, and science and technology, to ignite the idea and enhance online learning to become more motivating and reduce adolescent students’ boredom. © 2023, Instituto Universitário de Ciências Psicológicas, Sociais e da Vida.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145701874"

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein mediates the binding and is more prone to mutations resulting in the generation of different variants. Recently, molecules with the potential to inhibit the interaction of S protein with ACE2R have been of interest due to their therapeutic value. In this context, the present work was performed to identify potential RBD binders from the Indian medicinal plant's phytochemical database through virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamic simulation. Briefly, 1578 compounds filtered from 9596 phytochemicals were chosen for screening against the RBD of the native SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Based on the binding energy, the top 30 compounds were selected and re-docked individually against the native and five variants of concern (VOCs: alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omicron) of SARS-CoV-2. Four phytochemicals, namely withanolide F, serotobenine, orobanchol, and gibberellin A51, were found to be potential RBD binders in native and all SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Among the four, withanolide F exhibited lower binding energy (− 10.84 to − 8.56 kcal/mol) and better ligand efficiency (− 0.3 to − 0.25) against all forms of RBD and hence was subjected to a 100 ns MD simulation which confirmed its stringent binding to the RBDs in native and VOCs. The study prioritizes withanolide F as a prospective COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease) therapeutic agent based on the observations. It warrants deeper investigations into the four promising leads for understanding their precise therapeutic value.

At present, the purpose of this study is to explore the long-term influence of VR simulator teaching on the practice performance of medical students. Method: This is a one-year long-term follow-up study of a randomized controlled study. A total of 117 participants who completed the initial study were invited to participate in the follow-up study. Participants in the VR group and the control group were required to complete a questionnaire developed by the authors and the teachers in the teaching and research department and to provide their surgical internship scores and Objective Structure Clinical Examination(OSCE) graduation scores. Results: Of the 117 invitees, 108 completed the follow-up. The answers to the questions about career choice and study habits were more positive in the VR group than in the control group (p < 0.05). The total score for clinical practice in the VR group was better than that in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). In the OSCE examination, the scores for physical examination, suturing and knotting and image reading were higher in the VR group than in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The results of the one-year long-term follow-up indicated that compared with medical students experiencing the traditional teaching mode, those experiencing the VR teaching mode had more determined career pursuit and active willingness to learn, better evaluations from teachers in the process of surgical clinical practice, and better scores in physical examination, suturing and knotting and image reading in the OSCE examination. In the study of nonlinear dynamics to cultivate a good learning model for medical students, the VR teaching model is expected to become an effective and stable initial sensitive element.

Social encounters lead to the curiosity to know which facilitates both positive and negative learning. This phenomenon generally occurs in the classroom, but it can also happen in commonplace social interactions. It can take place in many formal, informal, and nonformal settings both consciously as well as unconsciously. According to the assumption of social learning, new behavior can be scooped up by emulation and imitation of other people present in the environment. According to this, learning is a cognitive function that happens within a social setting and may happen solely through explicit teaching or observing, even in the absence of bodily replication or explicit reward. Vicarious reinforcement is the term for the mechanism through which the acquisition of knowledge happens through observation of predicated incentives in addition to behavior. On the other hand, frequently rewarding a given behavior increases the likelihood that it will continue; on the other hand, sporadically punishing a certain action often increases the likelihood that it will stop. The idea goes beyond conventional behavioral suppositions, which only consider validation as a factor in behavior; instead, it addresses the prominent and central position that many internal dynamics play in the maturing individual. There have been strong connections observed between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) with those of cognitive processes called observational or social learning. The present society has witnessed significant advancements in technology, and ""AR"" is one such result of this development. Both AR and VR use simulations of real-world environments to potentially improve or supersede them. Utilizing the cameras on cell phones, AR typically enhances one's environment by overlaying technological features on a live stream. ""VR"" is an entirely intense encounter that substitutes a virtual experience for the actual world. In AR, a virtual world is created to dwell in the existing realm to provide users with more information about genuine reality without much effort. For instance, when a smartphone is pointed at a snippet of malfunctioning installation, commercial AR apps might instantly provide insights. VR is a comprehensive, realistic model that completely substitutes the customer's actual life with a digital one. These imaginary worlds are absolutely artificial, so they are frequently created to be grandiose and iconic. For instance, a client of VR might fight in a virtual fighting circle beside a fictional caricature of Mike Tyson. Since both AR and VR are intended to provide the customer with a recreated world, every idea is distinct and has a variety of applications. Owing to its capacity to provide digital configurations that add practical, real-life contexts, AR is progressively and constantly being adapted by companies in complement to infotainment settings. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177167344"

In a real video, blinking is an action often accompanied by speech, and it is also one of the indispensable actions in real face speech videos. However, the current methods either do not pay attention to the generation of eye movements, or cannot control the blinking in the generated results. To this end, this article proposes a novel system which produces vivid talking face with controllable eye blinks driven by the joint features including identity feature, audio feature, and blink feature. In order to disentangle the blinking action, we designed three independent features to individually drive the main components in the generated frame, namely the facial appearance, mouth movements, and eye movements. Through the adversarial training of the identity encoder, we filter out the information of the eye state from the identity feature, thereby strengthening the independence of the blinking feature. We introduced the blink score as the leading information of the blink feature, and through training, the value can be consistent with human perception to form a complete and independent control of the eyes. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our method can not only reproduce real talking faces, but also ensure that the blinking pattern and time are fully controllable.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136864941"

While readily compatible with photolithographic patterning methods, when electron beam (E-Beam) techniques are used, field distortion and stitching errors can result due to the buildup of charge. A common approach to overcome this issue is to deposit a thin conductive polymer layer (E-Spacer). However, if high-voltage E-Beam is used to achieve nano-features, the polymer conductivity is not sufficient. We have shown that by using chromium (Cr) as an overcoating conductive layer on the resist, we can achieve accurate and seamless patterning in multiple writing fields and used the method to fabricate on-chip Si3N4 waveguides on SiO2. This technique has the potential to enable the fabrication of large-scale integrated photonic systems on transparent or dielectric substrates.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177468767"

A comparison between the students who took the general education sustainability (GESU 121) course face to face and the ones who tool it online was applied. Design/methodology/approach: This study was descriptive in nature, and the data is obtained using a cross-sectional survey of the students attending the UAEU in 2020. The data collection was done in two semesters, Spring 2020 [face-to-face class] and Fall 2020 [online class, after COVID-19 effect]. A total of 160 participants responded to the survey. The Pearson’s Chi-square test for independence was conducted and used to identify if any statistical differences exist between the studied variables. Findings: This study revealed that the awareness of environmental sustainability was increased in both groups [face-to-face students and online students], after taking the course. In addition, around 80% of the students were interested to participate in sustainability initiatives on the UAEU campus. The students’ perception of the statements about the UAEU campus environmental sustainability varied from Spring 2020 (53.3% were not sure that the UAEU campus is environmentally sustainable) to Fall 2022 (63% of the online students believed that the campus is environmentally sustainable). Originality/value: Students’ awareness and perception are very important to improve the environmental sustainability of the University campus. The novelty of this study is to examine the awareness of entry-level students among the environmental sustainability focussing on the UAEU campus and examine the effect of COVID-19 [online classes] on delivering the course knowledge. The findings of this study provide the information for the improvement of the course for the future semesters. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158163381"

However, whether this social learning generalizes to similar but distinct interventions has not been explored nor what manipulations can reduce these effects. PURPOSE: To determine whether socially acquired nocebo effects can be generated by observing a negative experience with a similar, but distinct intervention, and whether choice can reduce these effects. METHODS: Across three experiments, a community sample of healthy adults (N = 336) either watched a confederate report cybersickness to the same Virtual Reality (VR) activity they were assigned to (Social Modeling: Consistent); a similar, but different VR activity (Social Modeling: Inconsistent); or did not view the confederate (No Social Modeling). Participants were either given choice over the VR (Choice) or assigned by the experimenter (No Choice). RESULTS: Across the experiments, there was significantly greater cybersickness in both Social Modeling groups relative to No Social Modeling, while the two Social Modeling groups did not differ. There was no significant effect of Choice or a Choice by Social Modeling interaction. Social Modeling elicited greater anxiety and expectancies for cybersickness. Furthermore, these mechanisms mediated the association between social modeling and cybersickness. CONCLUSIONS: Socially acquired side-effects were demonstrated to generalize to similar, but distinct interventions, highlighting the diffuse and robust effect social modeling can have on our experiences. However, choice did not attenuate the experience of cybersickness, highlighting the need for alternative methods to counteract the effect of social modeling. © The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Behavioral Medicine.; Witnessing someone experience cybersickness during Virtual Reality (VR) generated a nocebo effect in the observer, exacerbating their own symptoms when subsequently encountering VR. The nocebo effect was not specific to the VR activity witnessed, but generalized across different VR experiences, demonstrating that socially acquired nocebo effects are likely to spread rapidly. Choice of VR environment did not reduce the nocebo effect elicited in the observer.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177103822"

Recently, to facilitate a cost-effective and smooth transition from 4G to 5G networks, most carriers leverage existing 4G infrastructures using a dual connectivity (DC) feature. DC increases uplink throughput and mobility robustness; however, it also causes unprecedented dynamic fluctuations in radio channels due to the coverage discrepancy between 4G and 5G networks. Thus, in this article, we propose a self-attention-based deep learning model to predict uplink radio resources in 5G DC. We trained the proposed model on commercial 5G DC traffic data from three major carriers in South Korea and obtained an average prediction accuracy of 95.08% under various mobility and cell-load conditions. The proposed model explains the rationale for the obtained predictions by highlighting the parts of the input time-series data that are important to realize accurate prediction. We also demonstrate the usability of the proposed model using a network emulator based on real-world 5G trace data. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the existing congestion control algorithms can achieve excellent performance when used with the proposed model.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162642786"

Since AR imagery is overlaid on top of the user's view of their physical environment, these attention guidance techniques must not only compete with other virtual imagery, but also with distracting or attention-grabbing features in the user's physical environment. Because of the wide range of physical-virtual environments that pervasive AR users will find themselves in, it is difficult to design visual cues that 'pop out' to the user without performing a visual analysis of the user's environment, and changing the appearance of the cue to stand out from its surroundings. In this article, we present an initial investigation into the potential uses of dichoptic visual cues for optical see-through AR displays, specifically cues that involve having a difference in hue, saturation, or value between the user's eyes. These types of cues have been shown to be preattentively processed by the user when presented on other stereoscopic displays, and may also be an effective method of drawing user attention on optical see-through AR displays. We present two user studies: one that evaluates the saliency of dichoptic visual cues on optical see-through displays, and one that evaluates their subjective qualities. Our results suggest that hue-based dichoptic cues or 'Forbidden Colors' may be particularly effective for these purposes, achieving significantly lower error rates in a pop out task compared to value-based and saturation-based cues.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135751818"

A range of interventions to address sensory difficulties have been explored and virtual reality (VR) technology may offer a promising avenue for the provision of sensory interventions. In this study, preliminary evidence about the impact of Evenness, an immersive VR sensory room experience, for people with disabilities was investigated via a single intervention pre-post mixed methods design. Quantitative methodology included single intervention pre-post design (five month timeframe) with 31 adults with various developmental disabilities to determine the impact of use of aVR sensory room using a head mounted display (HMD) in relation to anxiety, depression, sensory processing, personal wellbeing and adaptive behaviour. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were also conducted with thirteen purposefully selected stakeholders following Evenness use. Results indicated significant improvements in anxiety, depression and sensory processing following Evenness use. Qualitative analysis corroborated the anxiety findings. No significant changes were observed in personal wellbeing or adaptive behaviour. Results are promising and indicate that a VR sensory room may have a positive impact on anxiety, depression and sensory processing for adults with disabilities. A longer study timeframe and a more rigorous experimental methodology is needed to confirm these findings. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146100118"

The rehabilitation process after musculoskeletal disorders is long and tedious, and patients are not motivated to follow rehabilitation protocols. Therefore, new systems must be used to increase patient motivation. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies can be used in this regard. In developing such systems, various technologies and methods of movement recognition are used; therefore, this study aims to summarize the technical aspects of using VR/AR in rehabilitation and evaluate and discuss efficient methods of investigating studies using the Statement of Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies (StaRI). Methods: Search in four scientific databases was done systematically based on PRISMA through online search engines from inception to June 2021. These databases include Medline (PubMed), Scopus, IEEE, and Web of Science. An updated search was also conducted on 17 December 2021. The research used keywords and MeSH terms associated with VR/AR, musculoskeletal disorder, and rehabilitation. Selected articles were evaluated qualitatively using the Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies (StaRI) statement. Results: A total of 2343 articles were found, and 20 studies were included. We found that 11 (55%) studies used Kinect technology as input tools, and 15 (75%) studies have described the techniques used to analyze human movements, such as dynamic time warping (DTW) and support vector machines (SVM). In 10 (50%) studies, the Unity game engine was used for visualization. In 8 studies (40%), usability was assessed, and high usability was reported. Similarly, the results of the review of studies according to the StaRI checklist showed poor reporting in the title and discussion of the studies. Conclusions: We found that academic studies did not describe the technical aspects of rehabilitation systems. Therefore, a good description of the technical aspects of the system in such studies should be considered to provide repeatability and generalizability of these systems for investigations by other researchers. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145431203"

Effects of locomotion, such as simulator sickness or disorientation, depend on the specific design of the locomotion method and can influence the task performance as well as the overall acceptance of the virtual reality system. Thus, it is important that a locomotion method achieves the intended effects. The complexity of this task has increased with the growing number of locomotion methods and design choices in recent years. Locomotion taxonomies are classification schemes that group multiple locomotion methods and can aid in the design and selection of locomotion methods. Like locomotion methods themselves, there exist multiple locomotion taxonomies, each with a different focus and, consequently, a different possible outcome. However, there is little research that focuses on locomotion taxonomies. We performed a systematic literature review to provide an overview of possible locomotion taxonomies and analysis of possible decision criteria such as impact, common elements, and use cases for locomotion taxonomies. We aim to support future research on the design, choice, and evaluation of locomotion taxonomies and thereby support future research on virtual reality locomotion.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139381931"

COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the tourist industry, notably in the areas of marketing, sustainability, and virtual worlds, even if VR is still a relatively young development in the sector. Virtual reality (VR) is often believed to provide visitors with the ""perfect"" vacation. This is due to the elimination of all drawbacks experienced by visitors to traditional tourist destinations. Despite VR's advantages and growing popularity, an important issue remains: will VR spell the death of traditional tourism, or is it only the beginning? This chapter examines the intersection between tourism and technology, with an emphasis on the part played by VR. The purpose of this chapter is to investigate whether VR tourism can replace traditional tourism or represents a distinct subset of the tourist industry. Tourism is placed and contextualized inside the VR domain, and the origins and evolution of VR are investigated in order to assess this astounding change in an ancient industry.

We studied mice palpating objects with their whiskers while navigating in a tactile virtual reality in darkness. Using two-photon Ca2+ imaging, we discovered that a population of neurons in the agranular RSC signal the location of objects. Responses to objects do not simply reflect the sensory stimulus. Instead, they are highly position, task, and context dependent and often predict the upcoming object before it is within reach. In addition, a large fraction of neurons encoding object location maintain a memory trace of the object's location. These data show that the RSC encodes the location and arrangement of tactile objects in a spatial reference frame. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173994519"

Results highlight substantial service changes and challenges, as observed by service providers.

We designed a multi-sensory setup involving avatar displayed on an HMD, and a set of vibrotactile effects displayed at every footstep. In a first study (N = 44), we compared the impression of walking in 3 vibrotactile conditions : 1) with a 'constant' vibrotactile rendering reproducing simple contact information, 2) with a more sophisticated 'phase-based' vibrotactile rendering the successive contacts of a walking cycle and 3) without vibrotactile feedback. The results show that overall both constant and phase-based rendering significantly improve the impression of walking in first and third-person perspective. Interestingly, the more realistic phase-based rendering seems to increase significantly the impression of walking in the third-person condition, but not in the first-person condition. In a second study (N=28), we evaluated the embodiment towards first- and third-person avatar while receiving no vibrotactile feedback or by receiving vibrotactile feedback. The results show that vibrotactile feedback improves embodiment in both perspectives of the avatar. Taken together, our results support the use of vibrotactile feedback when users observe first- and third-person avatar. They also suggest that constant and phase-based rendering could be used with first-person avatar and support the use of phase-based rendering with third-person avatar. They provide valuable insight for stimulations in any VR applications in which the impression of walking is prominent such as for virtual visits, walking rehabilitation, video games, etc. © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139824385"

This issue is exaggerated with the introduction of complex medical devices like endoscopes and robotic instrumentation. Although medical device manufacturers validate their cleaning instructions for use, evidence in the literature demonstrates that effective device processing is not being performed consistently within sterile processing departments in clinical settings. The result is increased risks to patient safety. As a solution to this problem, focused one-on-one training increases compliance to the medical device manufacturer's processing instruction. However, often this is not a practical solution for the volume of healthcare staff responsible for device processing activities. This constitutes the first paper to address the blended use of educational and digital technologies to address these challenges and as a result inform safety and sustainability for the medical device sector. Cognitive learning theory is an evidence-based framework for learning. It supports the use of immersive educational experiences using emerging extended reality technologies (e.g., virtual or augmented reality) to increase learning comprehension. The delivery of educational content via these technologies provides an innovative option for repeatable leaning and training outcomes. The motivation is to decrease patient risk of contaminated reusable medical devices. The proposed approach while primary motivated by safety can also enhance sustainability and efficiency enabled by artificial intelligence and robotic instrumentation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Note","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166756817"

However, optical flow limits the maximum speed and acceleration that can be effectively used without inducing cybersickness. In contrast, teleportation provides neither optical flow nor acceleration cues, and users can jump to any length without increasing cybersickness. However, teleportation cannot support continuous spatial updating and can increase disorientation. Thus, we designed 'HyperJump' in an attempt to merge benefits from continuous locomotion and teleportation. HyperJump adds iterative jumps every half a second on top of the continuous movement and was hypothesized to facilitate faster travel without compromising spatial awareness/orientation. In a user study, Participants travelled around a naturalistic virtual city with and without HyperJump (equivalent maximum speed). They followed waypoints to new landmarks, stopped near them and pointed back to all previously visited landmarks in random order. HyperJump was added to two continuous locomotion interfaces (controller- and leaning-based). Participants had better spatial awareness/orientation with leaning-based interfaces compared to controller-based (assessed via rapid pointing). With HyperJump, participants travelled significantly faster, while staying on the desired course without impairing their spatial knowledge. This provides evidence that optical flow can be effectively limited such that it facilitates faster travel without compromising spatial orientation. In future design iterations, we plan to utilize audio-visual effects to support jumping metaphors that help users better anticipate and interpret jumps, and use much larger virtual environments requiring faster speeds, where cybersickness will become increasingly prevalent and thus teleporting will become more important.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139384938"

However, few studies paid attention to studying barriers affecting VR’s adoption and their inner mechanisms. This makes AEC users hard to catch the key points for VR’s implementations. This study aims to get a clear structure of these barriers and provide insights for the improvement. Design/methodology/approach: First, 12 major VR-AEC adoption barriers were identified by a systematic literature review and expert interviews (EI). Second, EI and similarity aggregation method were conducted to achieve reliable barrier relationships. Third, interpretive structural modeling was used to establish a multi-level model for barriers. Finally, ten crucial barriers were targeted with a comprehensive strategy framework. Findings: The findings help AEC stakeholders get a thorough understanding of the VR-AEC adoption barriers. Besides, the inner mechanism among barriers is revealed and analyzed, followed by a systematic strategy framework. It is anticipated that users could conduct more effective VR-AEC promotions in the future. Originality/value: This paper is the first to propose a comprehensive literature review on the VR-AEC adoption barriers. In addition, this paper is novel in building a hierarchy model that explores barriers’ inner mechanism, where structural strategies are proposed. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131552412"

Like many outstanding industries, the travel and tourism industry has also improved its trends and technology with the benefit of VR and AR. AR is exhibiting an incredible part in transfiguring the tourism landscape and heightening the travel involvement for vacationers. In today's speeding world, many people travel around the globe and they look for better places to visit frequently to seek different environmental experiences. During their travel, tourism lovers keep on searching for places to visit and booking hotels and resorts on the go. So, if a travel agency wants to catch a traveler's attention with extensively changing travel applications, AR-established transit applications can help them by contributing a distinctive modest improvement. Like VR, AR adds digital features on top of the real world to provide a rich and beautiful experience of the locations that already exist. There are limitless advantages to AR in travel apps. It has a great deal of potential to support and provide creative innovations to the travel and tourism sector. There are many fantastic and growing uses for AR and VR that might benefit tourist commerce. Basically, the main objective of AR is that it improves and modifies how individuals see their immediate environment when viewed through a specific gadget. The creation of novel travel applications benefits impressively from AR and it becomes a treasured tool for businesses and vendors. The surroundings can be observed and enjoyed by the customers in their own way. The travel apps created on AR may easily draw users with their interactive and immersive experiences. It is very reasonable to say that AR may provide outstanding marketing experiences and can be used in the tourist business in a variety of ways. AR can be utilized and easily practiced in any smart electronic device and it is also very cheap as it could be never dreamt of when compared to VR devices. A wide range of crucial and sophisticated tasks are covered by the travel and tourism industry, including local transportation, accommodations, hospitality, and tourist sites. AR plays a vital role in the travel and tourism domain even if it is a smart young field in technical sciences. With so much potential to alter each of these areas, AR in tourism has a promising future. With the most intrinsic uses of AR, here are some assured illustrations of how AR can be used in travel app development. This chapter elucidates the prevailing and innovative AR travel applications and their use cases. Various location-based, marker-based, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) applications will be discussed in this chapter, and its advantages, as well as the future scope, will be enlightened. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177189704"

Time cells and place cells activate in parallel during timed navigation intervals, whereas a separate time cell sequence spans inter-task delays. The prevalence, firing rates, and behavioral coding strengths of time cells and place cells are indistinguishable—yet time cells selectively remap between search and retrieval tasks, while place cell responses remain stable.

Since the support for the Quieting Framework can be configured as mandatory in some networks, Quiet Intervals are assumed to be valid protection for R-TWT.

How to effectively reduce physical collisions and decrease user perceptions of redirection are important for most RDW methods. This article proposes a segmented redirection mapping method to calculate and map the roadmap of a large virtual space with inner obstacles to a mapped roadmap within a small real space. We adopt a Voronoi-based pruning method to extract the roadmap of the virtual space and design an RDW platform to interactively modify the virtual roadmap. We propose a roadmap mapping method based on divide-and-conquer and dynamic planning strategies to subdivide the virtual roadmap into several sub-virtual roads that are mapped individually. By recording connections of different sub-virtual roads, our method is applicable to virtual roadmaps with loop structures. During mapping, we apply the reset and redirection gains of the RDW technique as optimal aims and restrict conditions to obtain the mapped roadmap, which has small path curving and contains as few resets as possible. By real walking along the mapped roadmap, users perceive moving along the virtual roadmap to explore the entire virtual space. The experiment shows that our method works effectively for various virtual spaces with or without inner obstacles. Furthermore, our method is flexible in obtaining mapped roadmaps of different real spaces when the virtual space is fixed. Compared to prevalent RDW methods, our method can significantly reduce physical boundary collisions and maintain user experience of virtual roaming.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139433819"

Due to the stringent Quality of Service requirement of those applications, IEEE 802.11ad/ay have introduced contention free channel access called Service Period. One type of user traffic supported by IEEE 802.11ad is isochronous traffic, which is essentially periodic traffic that requires certain channel time to be allocated before its period ends. In an earlier work, we presented three Admission Control Algorithms (ACAs) which admit isochronous requests to achieve the above goals. One of these ACAs, the proportional fair allocation admission control (PFAAC), offers the best tradeoff across different performance metrics. But it did not consider guard time (GT) overhead, which is essential in a practical system. In this paper, we present two methods to compute upper bounds on GT overhead. We evaluate performance of the modified PFAAC with the two methods and PFAAC with no GT overhead. The modified PFAAC with the method that uses a tighter upper bound on GT overhead, provides the best performance. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139400234"

Most stress management training solutions have limitations associated with scaled adoption within the workforce. For instance, those that are effective in civilian populations often do not align with the human performance culture embedded within first-responder organizations. Programs involving expert-led instructions that are high in quality are often expensive. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to evaluate a tailored stress management training platform within the existing training schedule of the Australian Defense Force (ADF). The platform, known as Performance Edge (PE), is a novel virtual reality (VR) and biofeedback-enabled stress management skills training platform. Focusing on practical training of well-established skills and strategies, the platform was designed to take advantage of VR technology to generate an immersive and private training environment. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of delivering the VR platform within the existing group-based training context and intended training population. In this setting, the study further aimed to collect data on critical predictors of user acceptance and technology adoption in education, including perceived usability, usefulness, and engagement, while also assessing training impacts. METHODS: This study used a mixed methods, multisite approach to collect observational, self-reported, and biometric data from both training staff and trainers within a real-world ""on-base"" training context in the ADF. Validated scales include the Presence Questionnaire and User Engagement Scale for perceived usefulness, usability, and engagement, as well as the State Mindfulness Scale and Relaxation Inventory, to gain insights into immediate training impacts for specific training modules. Additional surveys were specifically developed to assess implementation feedback, intention to use skills, and perceived training impact and value. RESULTS: PE training was delivered to 189 ADF trainees over 372 training sessions. The platform was easy to use at an individual level and was feasible to deliver in a classroom setting. Trainee feedback consistently showed high levels of engagement and a sense of presence with the training content and environment. PE is overall perceived as an effective and useful training tool. Self-report and objective indices confirmed knowledge improvement, increased skill confidence, and increased competency after training. Specific training elements resulted in increased state mindfulness, increased physical relaxation, and reduced breathing rate. The ability to practice cognitive strategies in a diverse, private, and immersive training environment while in a group setting was highlighted as particularly valuable. CONCLUSIONS: This study found the VR-based platform (PE) to be a feasible stress management training solution for group-based training delivery in a defense population. Furthermore, the intended end users, both trainers and trainees, perceive the platform to be usable, useful, engaging, and effective for training, suggesting end-user acceptance and potential for technology adoption. ©Murielle G Kluge, Steven Maltby, Caroline Kuhne, Nicole Walker, Neanne Bennett, Eugene Aidman, Eugene Nalivaiko, Frederick Rohan Walker.

Still, the recent fourth industrial revolution [Industry 4.0 (I4.0)] paved the road toward Education 4.0. In this regard, several research challenges arise, involving the preparation of gamification strategies in online learning environments. In this sense, this paper aims to investigate the relationship between technologies of I4.0 and gamification practices in online learning around the world. Specifically, to categorize the studies of the scientific literature in the area into knowledge domains and the mention of I4.0 technologies and to verify the relationship of these technologies with the different educational levels. Design/methodology/approach: The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocol was used as a research method with 130 papers included for full content analysis and obtained from the Web of Science. Findings: The leading I4.0 technologies mentioned in the analyzed papers were simulation, Internet of Things and augmented/virtual reality, in this order. Although there are more mentioned technologies, the domain of knowledge to be applied and the educational level interfere in choosing these pillars. With this, the main findings of this relationship were exposed in a singular, modern, active, realist, technological framework to demonstrate how I4.0 relates to the practice of gamification in online educational environments.

People typically rely on environmental cues to determine their location and navigate their way. However, there is limited exploration into how individuals perceive their surroundings during emergency wayfinding. Through a virtual reality (VR) controlled experiment integrated with eye-tracking, this study explores how individuals sense the environment during evacuations. Participants were immersed in a virtual scenario simulating a building fire and had to choose between Routes 1 and 2 at an intersection for evacuations. The experimental results show individuals' visual attention is positively related to their wayfinding choices. Specifically, familiarity has a significant influence on individuals' visual attention and route choices. Participants who were familiar with Route 2 before evacuations showed increased fixation frequency but smaller saccade velocity during evacuations, reducing their likelihood of detecting the exit sign at the intersection and using Route 1. Neighbor behavior influenced participants' visual information searching and route choices. When virtual neighbors evacuated via Route 1 at the intersection, participants gazed at Route 1 more and were also more likely to use it. The visibility of the exit door on Route 1 also affected both participants' visual attention and route choices. However, the change in emergency lighting did not significantly influence participants’ route choices or their visual attention to Route 1 and the exit sign. These findings enrich our knowledge of human emergency wayfinding and hold significant implications for enhancing building design and evacuation planning. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173588257"

The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the usability of Imikode, a virtual reality (VR) game that was developed to introduce the concepts of object-oriented programming to novices. The improved version of the Imikode VR game consists of three features: An artificial intelligence component designed to provide real-time error feedback to users, an intelligent agent that guides and teaches users how to play the game and finally, the integration of multiple game play that gives learners more opportunities to explore the VR environment for greater immersive learning experience. This study adopted a survey approach and recruited first-year computer science students to measure learner satisfaction with educational virtual reality games and examined the correlations among the attributes of the Usefulness, Satisfaction and Ease of Use questionnaire of usage of Imikode. The results showed that the students were satisfied with Imikode and perceived the virtual reality educational game as very useful for learning object-oriented programming concepts. In addition, there was a correlation among the questionnaire variables, which means that researchers can use the instrument for future usability studies in the context.

The new status quo has, nevertheless, increased awareness of technology across many industries, particularly travel and hospitality. As a result, technology is being used in more inventive and profitable ways that help both businesses and consumers. The travel and leisure business is being impacted by technology like augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) in a wide range of ways. Virtual tours offer alternatives to the pandemic melancholy by enabling users to see locations they have always desired to visit while remaining in their own place. VR and AR solutions are increasingly being used in various tourism sectors, particularly at galleries, historical monuments, amusement parks, and theaters, in Asian cities including Tokyo, Beijing, Kuala Lumpur, Shanghai, Delhi, and Jaipur [6, 44]. The virtual world produced by these innovations is used as a cutting-edge advertising tool to draw visitors to these tourist spots and develop joint marketing destinations [6]. The availability of a wide range of AR and VR tools at the locations also aids the players in coming up with fresh ideas for revitalizing the location to enthrall more visitors and improve their overall quality of service. Therefore, AR and VR techniques are now being utilized more frequently to increase the overall experiences of tourists at a location, making a more interactive and diversified experience simpler and allowing them to engage with visitor attractions in unique ways [17]. However, until recently, relatively few studies have attempted to examine the combined significance of AR and VR approaches from the tourists' value co-creation perspective. Consequently, this chapter looks into the potential for incorporating AR and VR into the tourism experiences at the well-known historical monuments in Rajasthan with the goal of recommending a framework based on value co-creation. This will also imply that active implementation of AR and VR at historical monuments can help co-create value for the tourist's experiences before, during, and after their visit. This study will also present a case study on the prominent tourist destinations in Rajasthan where AR and VR technologies are being used to improve the visitor's overall destination experience. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177166735"

AR and VR can reduce challenges associated with conventional approaches via the simulation and mimicry of specific environments of choice for surgeons. Awake craniotomy (AC) enables the resection of lesions from eloquent brain areas while monitoring higher cortical and subcortical functions. Evidence suggests that both surgeons and patients benefit from the various applications of AR and VR in AC. This paper investigates the application of AR and VR in AC and assesses its prospective utility in neurosurgery. A systematic review of the literature was performed using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Our search results yielded 220 articles. A total of six articles consisting of 118 patients have been included in this review. VR was used in four papers, and the other two used AR. Tumour was the most common pathology in 108 patients, followed by vascular lesions in eight patients. VR was used for intraoperative mapping of language, vision, and social cognition, while AR was incorporated in preoperative training of white matter dissection and intraoperative visualisation and navigation. Overall, patients and surgeons were satisfied with the applications of AR and VR in their cases. AR and VR can be safely incorporated during AC to supplement, augment, or even replace conventional approaches in neurosurgery. Future investigations are required to assess the feasibility of AR and VR in various phases of AC. © 2022, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144306249"

The evidence informing the guidelines though is not specific to people living with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but rather comes from other disabling conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, and stroke. There remains a clear lack of direct evidence of the effects of physical activity for people living with TBI. The objective of this rapid review was to identify direct evidence of the effect of physical activity on health outcomes in people with moderate-to-severe TBI to inform adaptation of the WHO physical activity guidelines into clinical practice guidelines. Methods: We conducted a rapid systematic review with meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials, including people of any age with moderate-to-severe TBI, investigating physical activity interventions compared to either usual care, a physical activity intervention with different parameters, or a non-physical activity intervention. Four databases (CENTRAL, SPORTDiscus, PEDro, Ovid MEDLINE) were searched from inception to October 8, 2021. The primary outcomes were physical function, cognition, and quality of life. Results: Twenty-three studies were included incorporating 812 participants (36% females, majority working-age adults, time post-TBI in studies ranged from 56 days (median) to 16.6 years (mean)). A range of physical activity interventions were evaluated in rehabilitation (n = 12 studies), community (n = 8) and home (n = 3) settings. We pooled data from the end of the intervention for eight outcomes. Participation in a virtual reality physical activity intervention improved mobility, assessed by the Community Balance and Mobility Scale (range 0 to 96; higher score indicates better mobility) more than standard balance training (two studies, 80 participants, Mean Difference = 2.78, 95% CI 1.40 to 4.16; low certainty evidence). There was uncertainty of effect for the remaining outcomes, limited by small sample sizes, diverse comparators and a wide range of outcome measures. Conclusion: This review consolidates the current evidence base for the prescription of physical activity for people with moderate-to-severe TBI. There remains a pressing need for further rigorous research in order to develop practice guidelines to support clinical decision-making when prescribing physical activity in this population. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145956496"

Stroke recovery therapies are crucial in reducing the long-term disability burden after stroke. Stroke recovery treatment options have rapidly expanded within the last decade, and we are in the dawn of an exciting era of multimodal therapeutic approaches to improve post-stroke recovery. In this narrative review, we highlighted various promising advances in treatment and technologies targeting stroke rehabilitation, including activity-based therapies, non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques, robotics-assisted therapies, brain–computer interfaces, pharmacological treatments, and cognitive therapies. These new therapies are targeted to enhance neural plasticity as well as provide an adequate dose of rehabilitation and improve adherence and participation. Novel activity-based therapies and telerehabilitation are promising tools to improve accessibility and provide adequate dosing. Multidisciplinary treatment models are crucial for post-stroke neurorehabilitation, and further adjuvant treatments with brain stimulation techniques and pharmacological agents should be considered to maximize the recovery. Among many challenges in the field, the heterogeneity of patients included in the study and the mixed methodologies and results across small-scale studies are the cardinal ones. Biomarker-driven individualized approaches will move the field forward, and so will large-scale clinical trials with a well-targeted patient population. © 2023 by the authors.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176551491"

In our analysis, we account for uncertainty in model parameters, measured data, model errors, stochastic model inputs (e.g., rainfall, potential evapotranspiration), and climate scenarios. To afford this analysis, we rely on an extension of lumped hydrological models that includes groundwater flow and storage, called lumped geohydrological model (LGhM). It shows good model performance and is three orders of magnitude faster than 2D or 3D numerical groundwater models. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for Bayesian inference on a calibration period to quantify posterior parameter uncertainty and lumped data-and-model error. Then, we perform Monte Carlo forward runs with stochastic weather inputs under three different climate scenarios to quantify uncertainty in long-term predictions up to the year 2040. We apply our approach on a virtual reality representation of the Wairau Plain aquifer, New Zealand. We hypothesize that the variability in future climate is the most important impact factor. To test this hypothesis, we disentangle the overall uncertainty between data/model, parameters, weather, and climate inputs. We expect our approach to be highly useful for arbitrary types of catchments because the LGhM model structure can easily be adapted. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174164519"

Findings showed that participants confused their HR with underestimates up to 30%; environment did not affect CIAcc but influenced mind-related measures; modality did not influence CIAcc, however including audio increased interoceptive awareness; and VR presence inversely correlated with CIAcc.

Additionally, immersive environments can bring together people in remote locations, which has been increasingly applied in education applications with the use of technology to simulate real situations. However, effective interaction methods that improve the learning ability of people participating in educational activities in 3D immersive environments are yet to be well defined.

More recent VR systems, however, integrate cameras to track the headset's position inside the environment as well as the user's hands when possible. This allows users to directly interact with virtual content in mid-air just by reaching out, thus discarding the need for hand-held physical controllers. However, it is unclear which of these two modalities - controller-based or free-hand interaction - is more suitable for efficient input, accurate interaction, and long-term use under reliable tracking conditions. While interacting with hand-held controllers introduces weight, it also requires less finger movement to invoke actions (e.g., pressing a button) and allows users to hold on to a physical object during virtual interaction. In this paper, we investigate the effect of VR input modality (controller vs. free-hand interaction) on physical exertion, agency, task performance, and motor behavior across two mid-air interaction techniques (touch, raycast) and tasks (selection, trajectory-tracing). Participants reported less physical exertion, felt more in control, and were faster and more accurate when using VR controllers compared to free-hand interaction in the raycast setting. Regarding personal preference, participants chose VR controllers for raycast but free-hand interaction for mid-air touch. Our correlation analysis revealed that participants' physical exertion increased with selection speed, quantity of arm motion, variation in motion speed, and bad postures, following ergonomics metrics such as consumed endurance and rapid upper limb assessment. We also found a negative correlation between physical exertion and the participant's sense of agency, and between physical exertion and task accuracy.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174809312"

Here, we investigated whether temporal visuomotor synchrony affects avatar embodiment even when the movements of the virtual arms are spatially altered from those of the user in a non-human-like manner. In a within-subjects design VR experiment, participants performed a reaching task controlling an avatar whose lower arms bent in inversed and biomechanically impossible directions from the elbow joints. They performed the reaching task using this “unnatural avatar” as well as a “natural avatar,” whose arm movements and positions spatially matched the user. The reaching tasks were performed with and without a one second delay between the real and virtual movements. While the senses of body ownership and agency towards the unnatural avatar were significantly lower compared to those towards the natural avatar, temporal visuomotor synchrony did significantly increase the sense of embodiment towards the unnatural avatar as well as the natural avatar.

While previous research has provided rich visual data from human observers, existing gaze datasets often suffer from the absence of multimodal stimuli. Moreover, no dataset has yet gathered eye gaze trajectories (i.e., scanpaths) for dynamic content with directional ambisonic sound, which is a critical aspect of sound perception by humans. To address this gap, we introduce D-SAV360, a dataset of 4,609 head and eye scanpaths for 360° videos with first-order ambisonics. This dataset enables a more comprehensive study of multimodal interaction on visual behavior in virtual reality environments. We analyze our collected scanpaths from a total of 87 participants viewing 85 different videos and show that various factors such as viewing mode, content type, and gender significantly impact eye movement statistics. We demonstrate the potential of D-SAV360 as a benchmarking resource for state-of-the-art attention prediction models and discuss its possible applications in further research.

Plants remain in one area for extended periods, making them vulnerable to natural and man-made influences. Understanding plant drought responses will help us develop strategies for breeding drought-resistant crops. Large proteome analysis revealed that leaf and root tissue proteins respond to drought differently depending on the plant’s genotype. Commonly known as tomatoes, Solanum Lycopersicum is a globally important vegetable crop. However, drought stress is one of the most significant obstacles to tomato production, making the development of cultivars adapted to dry conditions an essential goal of agricultural biotechnology. Breeders have put quite a lot of time and effort into the tomato to increase its productivity, adaptability, and resistance to biotic and abiotic challenges. However, conventional tomato breeding has only improved drought resistance due to the complexity of drought traits. The resilience of tomatoes under drought stress has been the subject of extensive study. Using contemporary sequencing approaches like genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics has dramatically aided in discovering drought-responsive genes. One of the most prominent families of plant transcription factors, WRKY genes, plays a crucial role in plant growth and development in response to natural and abiotic stimuli. To develop plants that can withstand both biotic and abiotic stress, understanding the relationships between WRKY-proteins (transcription factors) and other proteins and ligands in plant cells is essential. This is despite the fact that tomatoes have a long history of domestication. This research aims to utilize Lupenone, a hormone produced in plant roots in response to stress, to increase drought resistance in plants. Lupenone exhibits a strong affinity for the WRKY protein at -9.64 kcal/mol. Molecular docking and modeling studies show that these polyphenols have a significant role in making Solanum Lycopersicum drought-resistant and improving the quality of its fruit. As a result of climate change, droughts are occurring more frequently and persisting for more extended periods, making it necessary to breed crops resistant to drought. While considerable variability for tolerance exists in wild cousins, little is known about the processes and essential genes influencing drought tolerance in cultivated tomato species.

State-of-the-art technologies are introduced, and future directions are discussed. Methods: Relevant literature is explored, analyzed, and summarized. Results: Soft tissue surgical robots had rapidly spread in the field of laparoscopic surgery based on the multi-degree-of-freedom movement of intra-abdominal surgical tools and stereoscopic imaging that are not possible in conventional surgery. The three key technologies that have made surgical robots successful are wire-driven mechanisms for multi-degree-of-freedom movement, master devices for intuitive remote control, and stereoscopic imaging technology. Recently, human-robot interaction technologies have been applied to develop user interfaces such as vision assistance and haptic feedback, and research on autonomous surgery has begun. Conclusion: Robotic surgery not only replaces conventional laparoscopic surgery but also allows for complex surgeries that are not possible with laparoscopic surgery. On the other hand, it is also criticized for its high cost and lack of clinical superiority or patient benefit compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery. As various robots compete in the market, the cost of surgical robots is expected to decrease. Surgical robots are expected to continue to evolve in the future due to the need to reduce the workload of medical staff and improve the level of care demanded by patients. © 2023, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174186772"

To achieve successful rehabilitation, it is important for patients to have a sense of efficacy in their ability to manage their disease well. Therefore, a virtual reality-based cognitive rehabilitation program based on self-efficacy theory was developed, and its effects were compared with conventional and computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation. The virtual reality-based cognitive rehabilitation program consisted of sessions lasting 30 min each five days a week for eight weeks. After applying the virtual reality-based cognitive rehabilitation program, there were significant differences in group-by-time interactions regarding stroke self-efficacy, cognitive function, visual perception, activities of daily living, and health-related quality of life. In addition, there were significant group differences among the three groups in terms of stroke self-efficacy and health-related quality of life. In conclusion, our virtual reality-based cognitive rehabilitation program developed based on self-efficacy theory is effective for inpatients with stroke and improves their stroke self-efficacy, cognitive function, visual perception, activities of daily living, and health-related quality of life. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176471025"

Education is a crucial industry that demands innovation to accomplish learning objectives and goals. Modern technology-based education has been globalized and interactive platforms allow students and educators to access, utilize, and benefit from all the educational content. The first research objective of this study is to develop a virtual reality science laboratory by utilizing the ADDIE Methodology, a popular instructional design model for instructional learning. The second objective is to analyze the presence experiences during learning sciences by using the Virtual Reality Science Laboratory by distributing a set of pretest and post-test questions to two different groups of 37 science students. Group 1, which is 20 students will learn about science through 2D videos while Group 2 consists of 17 students who will experience learning science through Virtual Reality Science Laboratory. The result shows that there is a significant level of presence between the two groups, and the VR group performs better. This study can help educators and developers design effective VR tools to learn science. For future research, we suggest including cognitive load as another variable to test with VR learning tools.

It incorporates semantic awareness, which improves motion representation and allows for precise and stylish animation generation. Existing methods for motion style transfer have all failed to consider the semantic meaning behind the motion, resulting in limited controls over the generated human animations. To improve, FineStyle introduces a new cross-modality fusion module called Dual Interactive-Flow Fusion (DIFF). As the first attempt, DIFF integrates motion style features and semantic flows, producing semantic-aware style codes for fine-grained motion style transfer. FineStyle uses an innovative two-stage semantic guidance approach that leverages semantic clues to enhance the discriminative power of both semantic and style features. At an early stage, a semantic-guided encoder introduces distinct semantic clues into the style flow. Then, at a fine stage, both flows are further fused interactively, selecting the matched and critical clues from both flows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FineStyle outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and controllability. By considering the semantic meaning behind motion style patterns, FineStyle allows for more precise control over motion styles.

In such situations, human speech perception is improved by speech reading, i.e., watching the movements of a speaker's mouth and face, either consciously as done by people with hearing loss or subconsciously by other humans. While previous work focused largely on speech perception of two-dimensional videos of faces, there is a gap in the research field focusing on facial features as seen in head-mounted displays, including the impacts of display resolution, and the effectiveness of visually enhancing a virtual human face on speech perception in the presence of noise. In this paper, we present a comparative user study (N=21) in which we investigated an audio-only condition compared to two levels of head-mounted display resolution (1832× 1920 or 916× 960 pixels per eye) and two levels of the native or visually enhanced appearance of a virtual human, the latter consisting of an up-scaled facial representation and simulated lipstick (lip coloring) added to increase contrast. To understand effects on speech perception in noise, we measured participants' speech reception thresholds (SRTs) for each audio-visual stimulus condition. These thresholds indicate the decibel levels of the speech signal that are necessary for a listener to receive the speech correctly 50% of the time. First, we show that the display resolution significantly affected participants' ability to perceive the speech signal in noise, which has practical implications for the field, especially in social virtual environments. Second, we show that our visual enhancement method was able to compensate for limited display resolution and was generally preferred by participants. Specifically, our participants indicated that they benefited from the head scaling more than the added facial contrast from the simulated lipstick. We discuss relationships, implications, and guidelines for applications that aim to leverage such enhancements.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174851910"

We recruited adults with NB due to spinal cord injury/disorder (SCI/D) or multiple sclerosis (MS) at three Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers to participate in 11 virtual focus groups. Audio transcripts were coded using a mixed approach with primary deductive codes linked to the Health Belief Model, and secondary inductive codes informed by grounded theory. Twenty-three Veterans (SCI/D, 78%; MS, 18.5%) participated between May 2021 and May 2022. Participants’ perspectives, experiences, and beliefs about UTI were reflected in three major themes: 1) influence of caregivers; 2) influence of the healthcare environment and provider characteristics; and 3) barriers and facilitators to care. Caregivers promoted care-seeking behavior, enabled in-home care, and enhanced participants’ self-efficacy to understand educational material. Participants had poor perceptions of providers who were not knowledgeable about NB or ineffectively communicated. Good relationships with providers who knew the participant well improved self-efficacy to follow provider recommendations. These results suggest that patient-centered interventions to improve UTI management in this population should expand caregiver involvement, enhance patient-provider communication, and target provider types and care settings that lack familiarity with NB. © 2023 Public Library of Science.

Blendshape based facial animation is a de-fact standard technique for expression synthesis of the digital avatars. A facial blendshape consists of a set of models corresponding to the typical semantic expressions. However, the blendshape is traditionally created by experienced artists using professional animation tools, which is time consuming and cost expensive. In this paper, we proposed an automatic facial blendshape generation method, which takes as input a set of template blendshapes and transfer the blendshape template to target subjects. It processes the model in the template blendshape one by one, and takes advantages of the deformation transfer technique to generate the personalized expression model for the target subject. Model penetration is a common problem incurred in the blendshape transfer process. To address this problem, we propose virtual edge constraints to prevent the penetration for the deformation transfer equation. It is noticed that the penetration is the result of self-intersection and usually occurs in the thin parts with two or more layers of surfaces, e.g. mouth, eye, and ear. To automatically detect the parts that are prone to penetration, we examine the geodesic distance and the Euclidean distance between the vertices of the target face model. If a pair of vertices have long geodesic distance but short Euclidean distance, then the corresponding area has high penetrating possibility. For such vertex pair, we create a virtual edge, and add a soft length constraint to preserve the length of the virtual edge with the aim to prevent penetration. The length constraint is implemented as preserving the transformed edge vector. We use two threshold values to control the distribution of the virtual edges. One threshold is on the Euclidian distance, by which we excludes the distant vertex pairs. The other threshold is on the geodesic-Euclidean distance ratio, by which we exclude the vertex pairs that have low geodesic-Euclidean distance ratio. For detailed face models with densely sampled vertices, there will be a large number of virtual edges connecting a given vertex, which maybe redundant for anti-penetration purpose. In this case, we keep 3–5 shortest virtual edges but discard the other longer ones. Once a virtual edge is formed, the other vertices near the edge ends are excluded for later virtual edge selection, in order to further reduce the number of the virtual edges. The modified optimization energy function for facial blendshape generation consists of two parts, one of which is the deformation transfer energy, and the other is virtual edge preservation energy. The virtual edge energy is weighted by a super parameter. In this way, both the inner surface and the outer surface in the multilayer parts are constrained to deform accordingly to avoid penetrate each other.We conduct a number of experiments to demonstrate the validity of the proposed virtual edge constraints in our facial blendshape generation methods. Experiments on different subjects, including scanned and designed models, show that the method can efficiently detect potential penetration areas and properly constructthe virtual edge constraints. When generating blendshapes with complex facial expressions, such as cheek contraction and pout, the proposed virtual edge constraints can effectively maintain the inner structural features and avoid the surface penetration.

As a result of digitization, a set of documents and application software are formed in a virtual reality environment. The concept of a digital twin is presented in the context of a model-based system design of the helicopter maintenance process according to the technical regulations. Based on statistical modeling technologies, a model for assembling aircraft units has been developed, in which time characteristics are qualitative estimates of learning processes and the effectiveness of digital twins. The results of experimental studies based on the method of analysis of students' certification using digital twins in the assembly of aircraft units are presented. It has been established that at the production site of an aircraft repair enterprise it is effective to apply training at the first stage using digital twins, and at the second stage using real objects. Based on analytical and experimental studies, regression models are proposed for the relationship between the optimal number of trainings at the second stage and the relative coefficient of training time for successful training and certification of mechanics and electronics engineers. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of virtual shopping budget-management training on executive functions and brain activation. Sixteen participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group that received virtual shopping budget-management training or the waitlist control group for a total of 16 sessions. To examine the effects of virtual shopping budget-management training on brain activation, HbO2 was measured in the prefrontal cortex via functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during the Trail Making Test Part B (TMT-B) and Stroop test. Mann–Whitney and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare outcomes between and within the two groups. The virtual shopping budget-management training showed no significant difference in all outcomes between both groups (p > 0.05). No significant differences were observed in HbO2 levels during both TMT-B (p > 0.05) and the Stroop test (p > 0.05). However, in the pre-post comparisons, there was a significant difference in the TMT-B (p < 0.05) and Stroop test (p < 0.05) in the experimental group.

Property viewing is an important step in the sales process in the real estate industry, and it frequently takes a lot of time and effort from both buyers and agents. Traditional methods of property viewing, such as physical visits or two-dimensional (2D) photos, may not always provide an accurate representation of the property, leading to dissatisfaction and lost sales opportunities. However, the emergence of virtual reality (VR) technology has created new opportunities to offer immersive and engaging experiences to prospective customers, even when buyers are unable to physically visit the properties. VR technology enables potential buyers to explore properties from different angles, customise virtual settings, and interact with different features in real-time, creating a more dynamic and memorable experience. This paper reviews the adoption of VR technology from the perspective of real estate marketing to enhance the marketing of properties. Five prominent databases were utilised to conduct the literature study, focusing on data published between 2018 and 2023, and several inclusion criteria were established for the literature search. The main finding concluded that the use of VR technology in real estate marketing could substantially provide competitive advantages by allowing potential buyers to explore properties at their convenience and making the buying process easier. It is also important to note that the use of VR technology in real estate marketing could substantially provide competitive advantages by allowing potential buyers to explore properties at their convenience and making the buying process more efficient. However, the readiness to optimise VR technology is hindered due to a lack of awareness and perception of its complexity. Therefore, significant investment should be considered by real estate practitioners to provide training for the extensive integration of VR technology within the industry. By identifying the benefits and challenges of using VR technology, this study will help guide the development of effective marketing strategies for the Malaysian real estate industry. © 2023, Penerbit Akademia Baru.

Increasingly, users are shifting to mobile devices and connecting to the Internet via mobile-cellular networks. As the ideal media for 360° videos, some VR headsets now also come with cellular capacity, giving them potential for mobile applications. However, streaming high-quality 360° live video poses challenges for network bandwidth, particularly on cellular connections. To reduce bandwidth requirements, videos can be compressed using viewport-adaptive streaming or foveated rendering techniques. Such approaches require very low latency in order to be effective, which has previously limited their applications on traditional cellular networks. In this work, we demonstrate an end-to-end virtual reality telepresence system that streams ∼6K 360° video over 5G millimeter-wave (mmW) radio. Our use of 5G technologies, in conjunction with mobile edge compute nodes, substantially reduces latency when compared with existing 4G networks, enabling high-efficiency foveated compression over modern cellular networks on par with WiFi. We performed a technical evaluation of our system's visual quality post-compression with peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and FOVVideoVDP. We also conducted a user study to evaluate users' sensitivity to compressed video. Our findings demonstrate that our system achieves visually indistinguishable video streams while using up to 80% less data when compared with un-foveated video. We demonstrate our video compression system in the context of an immersive, telepresent video calling application.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174845226"

Here, we report 3 experiments investigating this idea. In a virtual reality task, healthy participants were approached and touched near or on their hand with a coloured pen (blue or yellow). During acquisition, participants learned that one of the colours of the pen (CS+) was predictive of a painful electrocutaneous stimulus (ECS) whereas the other coloured pen (CS-) was not. During the test phase, more frequent reports of experiencing an US when none was delivered (""false alarm"") for the CS+ vs CS- qualified as evidence of conditioned pain. Notable differences between experiments were that the US was delivered when the pen touched a spot between the thumb and index finger (experiment 1; n = 23), when it virtually touched the hand (experiment 2; n = 28) and when participants were informed that the pen caused pain rather than simply predicting something (experiment 3; n = 21). The conditioning procedure proved successful in all 3 experiments: Self-reported fear, attention, pain, fear, and US expectancy were higher (P < 0.0005) for the CS+ than the CS-. There was no evidence for conditioned pain in experiment 1, but there was some evidence in experiments 2 and 3. Our findings indicate that conditioned pain may exist, albeit most likely in rare cases or under specific situations. More research is needed to understand the specific conditions under which conditioned pain exists and the underlying processes (eg, response bias). © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This is especially true for VR industrial applications where users need to input data frequently. Large-scale industrial adoption of VR is still hampered by the productivity gap between entering data via a physical keyboard and VR data entry methods. Data entry needs to be efficient, easy-to-use and to learn and not frustrating. In this paper, we present a new data entry method based on handwriting recognition (HWR). Users can input text by simply writing on a virtual surface. We conduct a user study to determine the best writing conditions when it comes to surface orientation and sensory feedback. This feedback consists of visual, haptic, and auditory cues. We find that using a slanted board with sensory feedback is best to maximize writing speeds and minimize physical demand. We also evaluate the performance of our method in terms of text entry speed, error rate, usability and workload. The results show that handwriting in VR has high entry speed, usability with little training compared to other controller-based virtual text entry techniques. The system could be further improved by reducing high error rates through the use of more efficient handwriting recognition tools. In fact, the total error rate is 9.28% in the best condition. After 40 phrases of training, participants reach an average of 14.5 WPM, while a group with high VR familiarity reach 16.16 WPM after the same training. The highest observed textual data entry speed is 21.11 WPM.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174829820"

However, most existing research is hardly adapted to time-varying resources and dynamic multicast service function chaining (SFC) requests in the real-world network. This paper proposes a soccer league competition algorithm with multicast SFC request prediction (SLC-MSRP), which can foresee the incoming multicast SFC requests (MSRs) based on the Informer model. Based on multi-dimensional individual coding strategy, SLC-MSRP handles the SFC mapping of all active multicast groups simultaneously and deploys the predicted MSRs in advance. A fast repair strategy consisting of forward and backward search phases is developed to handle the differences between the predicted results and the actual arrival MSRs. Simulation results show that Informer achieves lower mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values in the MSR prediction than two existing prediction models. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm gains lower MSR response time while achieving better performance in terms of end-to-end delay and computational resource consumption compared with seven state-of-the-art heuristic and deep reinforcement learning algorithms. © 2023 Science Press.

Previous research investigated reference frames in isolation, for example, by shifting landmarks relative to the target and asking participants to reach to the remembered target location. Systematic reaching errors were found in the direction of the landmark shift and used as a proxy for allocentric spatial coding. Here, we examined the interaction of both allocentric and egocentric reference frames by shifting the landmarks as well as the observer. We asked participants to encode a three-dimensional configuration of balls and to reproduce this configuration from memory after a short delay followed by a landmark or an observer shift. We also manipulated the number of landmarks to test its effect on the use of allocentric and egocentric reference frames. We found that participants were less accurate when reproducing the configuration of balls after an observer shift, which was reflected in larger configurational errors. In addition, an increase in the number of landmarks led to a stronger reliance on allocentric cues and a weaker contribution of egocentric cues. In sum, our results highlight the important role of egocentric cues for allocentric spatial coding in the context of memory-guided actions.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Objects in our environment are coded relative to each other (allocentrically) and are thought to serve as independent and reliable cues (landmarks) in the context of unreliable egocentric signals. Contrary to this assumption, we demonstrate that egocentric cues alter the allocentric spatial memory, which could reflect recently discovered interactions between allocentric and egocentric neural processing pathways. Furthermore, additional landmarks lead to a higher contribution of allocentric and a lower contribution of egocentric cues.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175271287"

Then, it will analyse the various positions taken by some key stakeholders on the issues of above and the regulation of the design and use of such technologies, examining these perspectives through the lenses of “Digital Constitutionalism”. Particularly, this paper will emphasise the role that civil society can play in such dynamics (Section 3). Subsequently, it will further promote an active and forward-looking approach in addressing the looming threats these and other AI-based technologies could pose to fundamental rights and society as a whole (Section 4). As we already approach the next AI era without even noticing, the question worth asking ourselves is: “What will generative and AI-powered oracles reveal about us?” (Section 5). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174621599"

These virtual input surfaces can closely replicate the experience of typing on a Qwerty keyboard on a physical touchscreen, thereby allowing users to leverage their pre-existing typing skills. However, the lack of passive haptic feedback, unconstrained user motion, and potential tracking inaccuracies or observability issues encountered in this interaction setting typically degrades the accuracy of user articulations. We present a comprehensive exploration of error-tolerant probabilistic hand-based input methods to support effective text input on a mid-air virtual Qwerty keyboard. Over three user studies we examine the performance potential of hand-based text input under both gesture and touch typing paradigms.

Layers ordered in diopter space contain color and transparency so that a complete image is formed when the layers are composited in a view-dependent manner. Once baked, the same limitations apply to multi-layer images as to conventional single-layer photography, making it challenging to remove obstructive objects or otherwise edit the content. Object removal before baking can benefit from filling disoccluded layers with pixels from background layers. However, if no such background pixels have been observed, an inpainting algorithm must fill the empty spots with fitting synthetic content. We present and study a multi-layer inpainting approach that addresses this problem in two stages: First, a volumetric area of interest specified by the user is classified with respect to whether the background pixels have been observed or not. Second, the unobserved pixels are filled with multi-layer inpainting. We report on experiments using multiple variants of multi-layer inpainting and compare our solution to conventional inpainting methods that consider each layer individually.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174858383"

Given that VR headsets track real physical movements and map them onto one’s avatar body, the nature of one’s digital representation is an important aspect of social VR. However, little is known about how the visual proximity of an avatar to the self shapes user experience in naturalistic, social VR environments. In this article, we use this context to explore how embodiment is influenced by the perceived differences between the physical attributes of a user and the virtual attributes of their avatar. We selected a number of attributes for this measure that have been shown to be important for customization and representation in VR. Participants created an avatar, spent time in social VR, and reported on their experience in a questionnaire. Our results demonstrate a significant negative association between attribute discrepancy and avatar embodiment, the psychological experience of one’s virtual body as their own body. We discuss implications for theories of self-representation and suggest urgency on the part of games and VR designers to improve the methods of creating avatars. © 2023 Mary Ann Liebert Inc..

A key topic in TVE planning is the optimal placement of shelters, which is typically studied using a top-down approach. Recently, virtual reality (VR) has become an emerging tool to support disaster risk reduction and emergency response training. While VR has been applied to visualise tsunami flood zones and evacuation routes, no studies have used VR to assess the evacuees' shelter choices during emergencies or to examine the optimal 'siting' of TVE buildings. To address this gap, this study introduces a user-focused VR evacuation experiment to automatically collect the shelter preferences of 435 participants regarding existing buildings that might serve as TVE shelters in four case studies in Chile. Complementary, we used questionnaires to collect information about the participants' tsunami evacuation expertise, awareness, and the factors that led to their shelter selection. Lastly, we used GIS to examine the location characteristics of the selected buildings. The results showed that 50 buildings gathered at least two preferences, with a large diversity of heights (five to 34 storeys) and placements (from 52 to 2774 m from the coast). Height is the most critical factor when choosing a building for TVE (53.1 % of the preferences), and most of them are residential (62.7 %). Additionally, 67.2 % of the participants had experienced real-world evacuations, and the average evacuation rate during the last emergency in each of the case studies was 43.8 %. While most participants declared affirmative response rates about the perceived tsunami threat (above 60 %), low specific knowledge regarding evacuation plans might discourage protective actions in future tsunami emergencies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176433927"

The treatment of neuropathic pain is challenging due to its heterogeneous etiologies, lack of objective diagnostic tools and resistance to classical analgesic drugs. First-line treatments recommended by the Special Interest Group on Neuropathic Pain (NeuPSIG) and European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) include gabapentinoids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Nevertheless these treatments have modest efficacy or dose limiting side effects. There is therefore a growing number of preclinical and clinical studies aim at developing new treatment strategies to treat neuropathic pain with better efficacy, selectivity, and less side effects. In this review, after a brief description of the mechanisms of action, efficacy, and limitations of current therapeutic drugs, we reviewed new preclinical and clinical targets currently under investigation, as well as promising non-pharmacological alternatives and their potential co-use with pharmacological treatments. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173903297"

Nevertheless, any detailed recommendation on using a navigation system to treat nasal bone fracture has never been discussed. Plastic surgeons are prone to do closed reduction of nasal bone fractures with remnant posttraumatic edema in the pediatric population. This study hypothesized that the navigation system benefits this population's treatment of nasal bone fractures. Methods: The authors evaluated the medical records, plain x-ray, and facial computed tomography scans of 44 pediatric patients (below the age of 18) with nasal bone fractures treated with a closed reduction from May 2021 to December 2022. Preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scan were used to assess the outcome. Results: The average age for 44 pediatric nasal bone fracture patients was 10. Fifteen were female, while males were 29. All cases were successfully corrected clinically and radiologically without noticeable complications. Conclusions: Using navigation systems to correct nasal bone fractures provides additional benefits for the pediatric population. This technique is especially useful if the fracture is located at the junction between the nasal bone and nasal process of the maxilla and is combined with concurrent old nasal bone fractures. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Despite the popularity of VR, tools simplifying the creation and data management of such experiments are rare and often restricted to a specific scope-limiting usability and comparability. To overcome those limitations, we introduce the Virtual Navigation Toolbox (VNT), a collection of interchangeable and independent tools for the development of spatial navigation VR experiments using the popular Unity game engine. The VNT's features are packaged in loosely coupled and reusable modules, facilitating convenient implementation of diverse experimental designs. Here, we depict how the VNT fulfils feature requirements of different VR environments and experiments, guiding through the implementation and execution of a showcase study using the toolbox. The presented showcase study reveals that homing performance in a classic triangle completion task is invariant to translation velocity of the participant's avatar, but highly sensitive to the number of landmarks.

Ninety participants were engaged in the experiment that required cognitive tasks for 10 min with a 2-min virtual reality (VR) break. During the VR break, they experienced six different scenes which were three green coverage ratios (0%, 25% and 60%), two room volumes (940 m3 and 1713 m3), and two window sizes. The results showed that visual comfort, mood, self-reported recovery, and productivity were better in cases with greenery than without. Mean heart rate differences between the test and break periods were 3.1 bpm lower in the spaces with small window size than those with big window size. This suggested that participants might experience physiological stress due to low prospect in the spaces with high green coverage ratio and small windows. The relationships between green coverage ratio, spaciousness, and psychological responses such as environmental satisfaction, mood and self-reported performance were analyzed.

Virtual avatars allow users to experience the adaptation, control, and perceptual illusion of alternative bodies. Although virtual bodies have medical applications in motor rehabilitation and therapeutic interventions, their potential for learning anatomy and medical communication remains underexplored. For learners and patients, anatomy, procedures, and medical imaging can be abstract and difficult to grasp. Experiencing anatomies, injuries, and treatments virtually through one's own body could be a valuable tool for fostering understanding. This work investigates the impact of avatars displaying anatomy and injuries suitable for such medical simulations. We ran a user study utilizing a skeleton avatar and virtual injuries, comparing to a healthy human avatar as a baseline. We evaluate the influence on embodiment, well-being, and presence with self-report questionnaires, as well as motor performance via an arm movement task. Our results show that while both anatomical representation and injuries increase feelings of eeriness, there are no negative effects on embodiment, well-being, presence, or motor performance.

Understanding the route choices of cyclists and their motivation based on their preferences regarding their trip attributes is essential to improve cycling infrastructure and encourage active travel modes such as cycling. This research aims to explore the influence of streetscape design features (SDFs) on cyclists' route choices by developing a mixed-method approach to collect objective and subjective data from 22 volunteers. We used a survey (Maptionnaire) with a virtual reality (VR) and eye-tracking experiment to simulate a bicycle trip in Enschede, The Netherlands. Results showed that despite differences between usual and ideal routes regarding SDFs (such as the presence of vegetation, water bodies, and road intersections), factors such as infrastructure provision and quality have a more significant impact when choosing a route. The novelty of the proposed methodology lies in combining data from the different methods to improve understanding regarding the influence of SDFs in cyclists' route choices and raise awareness among the participants about the influence of SDFs on their route choices.

With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of digital health technologies such as chatbots has accelerated. Objectives: This study aims to investigate the application of AI chatbots in combating the COVID-19 pandemic and explore their features. Methods: We reviewed the literature on health chatbots during the COVID-19 pandemic. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched using relevant keywords such as “chatbot”, “conversational agent,” and “artificial intelligence”. To select the relevant articles, we conducted title, abstract, and full-text screening based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Chatbots, their applications, and design features were extracted from the selected articles. Results: Out of 673 articles initially identified, 17 articles were eligible for inclusion. We categorized the selected AI chatbots based on their roles, applications, and design characteristics. Around 70% of chatbots were designed to play a preventive role. Our review identified 8 key applications of the AI chatbots during the COVID-19 pandemic, which include (1) information dissemination and education, (2) self-assessment and screening, (3) connecting to health centers, (4) combating misinformation and fake news, (5) patient tracking and service delivery (6) mental health (7) monitoring exposure (8) vaccine information and scheduling. AI chatbots were deployed on various platforms, including mobile apps, web, and social media. Mobile-based chatbots were the most frequent. All chatbots used Natural Language Understanding (NLU) methods to understand natural language input and act on the user’s request. More than 50% of AI chatbots used NLU platforms, including Google Dialogflow, Rasa framework, and IBM Watson. Conclusions: AI chatbots can play an effective role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing people’s awareness, optimizing the use of health resources, and reducing unnecessary encounters are some of the advantages of using AI chatbots during the COVID-19 outbreak. Using NLU platforms can be a suitable solution for developing AI chatbots in the healthcare domain. With advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, it seems that AI chatbots will have a promising future in healthcare, particularly in public health, chronic disease management, and mental health. © 2023, Mahdavi et al.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177037044"

Here, we tested for potential oscillatory alignment and power modulation at behaviorally relevant frequencies in magnetoencephalography (MEG) data acquired during a virtual reality-based, rhythmic hand-target phase matching task. The task contained conditions differing in terms of visuomotor incongruence and whether or not behavior (grasping movements) had to be adapted to keep vision aligned with the target. We tested for potential oscillatory alignment with movement frequencies and cross-frequency coupling with oscillations in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands. Our results revealed local peaks at 1 Hz power, corresponding to the frequency at which hand movements alternated between open and close; thus, potentially indicating an ""entrainment"" of neural oscillations at key movement frequencies. We found 1 Hz power was selectively enhanced when participants needed to align incongruent vision with the target. Moreover, the phase of the ""movement-entrained"" 1 Hz oscillations coupled significantly with the momentary amplitude of beta band oscillations-again, this coupling was selectively enhanced when incongruent vision was task relevant. We propose that this reflected a top-down mechanism, most likely related to selective attention and rhythmic sensory sampling. Thus, phasic low-frequency (beta) power suppression likely indicated a variable (attentional) sampling of visual movement feedback; i.e., related to increased sensitivity for visually matching alternating hand movements to a phasic target at ecologically important time points, rather than continually during the grasping cycle.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our results reveal an increased spectral power at movement frequencies in a rhythmic hand-target phase matching task under visuomotor conflict; this effect was strongest when incongruent visual movement feedback was required to guide action. Moreover, the phase of these slow frequencies coupled with the momentary power beta oscillations; again, this coupling was selectively strengthened when incongruent vision was task relevant.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177103435"

As an essential branch of point cloud data processing, cloud classification has important research significance and value. However, this task poses challenges due to the sparsity, irregularity, and unordered nature of point cloud data. Among most of the methods dealing with this problem, there are problems of inadequate extraction of local features, low accuracy of classification, and poor generalization of point cloud data. Therefore, this paper addresses the above issue. This paper presents an improved 3D point cloud classification network by enhancing the Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN). Firstly, this paper combines K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and ball radius query for feature extraction to better capture the local structural information in cloud classification data. Secondly, a conventional convolution layer is incorporated between the second and third graph convolution layers to enhance the feature representation in the proposed approach. Finally, this paper uses a global pooling method that combines maximum pooling and average pooling to construct the global structure of the point cloud while preserving the most critical information. Realize 3D point cloud classification. The experimental results demonstrate a 0.9% improvement in accuracy on the ModelNet40 dataset using the proposed improved method. This validates the effectiveness of the enhancement process described in this paper and offers valuable insights for enhancing the performance and application of point cloud classification. © 2023, International Association of Engineers.

In this paper, we proposed novel optimization-driven alignment-based and Artificial Potential Field (APF) redirected walking controllers, as well as an integrated version of the two. The first two controllers employ objective functions of one variable, which is the included angle between the user's heading vector and the target vector originating from the user's physical position. The optimized angle represents the physical cell that is best aligned with the virtual cell or the target vector on which the designated point has the minimum APF value. The derived optimized angle is used to finely set RDW gains. The two objective functions can be optimized simultaneously, leading to an integrated controller that is potentially able to take advantage of the alignment-based controller and APF-based controller. Through extensive simulation-based studies, we found that the proposed alignment-based and integrated controllers significantly outperform the state-of-the-art controllers and the proposed APF based controller in terms of the number of resets.

Recent reports asserted that this diabetes medication can also shield users from cancer. Metformin induces cell cycle arrest in cancer cells. However, the exact mechanism by which this occurs in the cancer system is yet to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the impact of metformin on cell cycle arrest in cancer cells utilizing transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta pathway. TGF-β pathway has significant effect on cell progression and growth. In order to gain an insight on the underlying molecular mechanism of metformin's effect on TGF beta receptor 1 kinase, molecular docking was performed. Metformin was predicted to interact with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta receptor I kinase based on molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, pharmacophore was generated for metformin- TGF-βR1 complex to hunt for novel compounds having similar pharmacophore as metformin with enhanced anti-cancer potentials. Virtual screening with 29,000 natural compounds from NPASS database was conducted separately for the generated pharmacophores in Ligandscout® software. Pharmacophore mapping showed 60 lead compounds for metformin-TGF-βR1 complex. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation for 100 ns and ADMET analysis were performed on these compounds. Compounds with CID 72473, 10316977 and 45140078 showed promising binding affinities and formed stable complexes during dynamics simulation with aforementioned protein and thus have potentiality to be developed into anti-cancer medicaments.  © 2023 Reza et al.

This is important for students because this mental activity increases a sense of control and confidence in fulfilling learning tasks, thus increasing self-efficacy, motivation, and autonomy in learning. Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) helps students progress and develop personally and socially. It is known that educators usually train self-regulated using learning media such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), games, augmented reality, virtual reality, and others. However, games are the most easiest and enjoyable learning media because games can promote independent learning in a constructivist, social problem-solving context. Some games would be better if they were developed with learning in mind. Therefore, the research objective of this paper is to develop games that can enhance self-regulatory learning. The type of study used was a 4D modeling application development study with the participation of 120 vocational high school students. The results showed that students who used game-based mobile learning improved in three aspects of self-regulated learning: metacognition, motivation, and behavior. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176468310"

Previous research demonstrated that the sense of embodiment toward an avatar can impact user behavior and cognition. In this paper, we present an experiment designed to investigate whether embodying a well-known creative genius could enhance participants' creative performance. Following a preliminary online survey (N = 157) to select a famous character suited to the purpose of this study, we developed a VR application allowing participants to embody Leonardo da Vinci or a self-avatar. Self-avatars were approximately matched with participants in terms of skin tone and morphology. 40 participants took part in three tasks seamlessly integrated in a virtual workshop. The first task was based on a Guilford's Alternate Uses test (GAU) to assess participants' divergent abilities in terms of fluency and originality. The second task was based on a Remote Associates Test (RAT) to evaluate convergent abilities. Lastly, the third task consisted in designing potential alternative uses of an object displayed in the virtual environment using a 3D sketching tool. Participants embodying Leonardo da Vinci demonstrated significantly higher divergent thinking abilities, with a substantial difference in fluency between the groups. Conversely, participants embodying a self-avatar performed significantly better in the convergent thinking task. Taken together, these results promote the use of our virtual embodiment approach, especially in applications where divergent creativity plays an important role, such as design and innovation.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174857818"

The biophilia hypothesis suggests that humans have an innate tendency to seek connections with the natural world and there is increasing evidence that biophilic design such as the incorporation of green plants can yield health benefits. Recently, virtual reality (VR) has been used to regulate stress and improve overall wellness, particularly by incorporating natural settings. In this randomized crossover study, we designed five virtual classroom scenes with different biophilic elements and turbidity in VR and investigated whether the visual stimulations can affect the stress levels and cognitive functions of 30 young adults from a university in China. We measured their physiological indicators of stress reaction by wearable biomonitoring sensors (blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and skin conductance level (SCL)), conducted verbal cognitive tests on attention and creativity, and evaluated subjective/perceived (self-reported) stress levels and connection with nature. Albeit our results suggested no significant change in physiological stress reactions or cognitive functions induced by the biophilic and turbid interventions in VR, the addition of biophilic elements in the Metaverse could benefit students’ health due to significantly decreased perceived stress levels and increased connections with nature. © 2023 You et al.

The joint agency has been actively investigated in diverse contexts (e.g., performance, reward schedules, and predictability), yet the studies were mostly conducted in traditional 2D computer environments. Since virtual reality (VR) is an emerging technology for remote collaboration, we aimed to probe the effects of traditional reward schedule factors along with novel VR features (i.e., avatar visibility) on joint agency during remote collaboration. In this study, we implemented an experiment based on a card-matching game to test the effects of the reward schedule (fair or equal) and the counterpart's avatar hand visibility (absent or present) on the sense of joint agency. The results showed that participants felt a higher sense of joint agency when the reward was distributed equally regardless of the individual performance and when the counterpart's avatar hand was present. Moreover, the effects of reward schedule and avatar hand visibility interacted, with a bigger amount of deficit for the absent avatar hand when the reward was distributed differentially according to performance. Interestingly, the sense of joint agency was strongly correlated to the level of collaborative performance, as well as to perceptions of other social cognitive factors, including cooperativeness, reward fairness, and social presence. These results contribute to the understanding of joint agency perceptions during VR collaboration and provide design guidelines for remote collaborative tasks and environments for users' optimal social experience and performance.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174825691"

This property can be evaluated with the co-immersion criterion, which encompasses scenes constituted by arbitrary configurations of real and virtual objects. Thus, we introduce the term Audio Augmented Virtuality (AAV) to describe a fully virtual environment consisting of auditory content captured from the real world, augmented by synthetic sound generation. We propose an experimental design in AAV investigating how simplified late reverberation (LR) affects the co-immersion of a sound source. Participants listened to simultaneous virtual speakers dynamically rendered through spatial Room Impulse Responses, and were asked to detect the presence of an impostor, i.e., a speaker rendered with one of two simplified LR conditions. Detection rates were found to be close to chance level, especially for one condition, suggesting a limited influence on co-immersion of the simplified LR in the evaluated AAV scenes. This methodology can be straightforwardly extended and applied to different acoustics scenes, complexities, i.e., the number of simultaneous speakers, and rendering parameters in order to further investigate the requirements for immersive audio technologies in AAR and AAV applications.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174807845"

Spatial ability plays an important role in human life, including academic achievement and advancement in work settings. Spatial ability is known to be improved by practicing relevant tasks. Mental rotation and spatial perception are among such tasks that improve spatial skills. In this research, we investigated a 'mirror-reversed' interaction technique in a cup stacking task in VR and looked into its effects on spatial ability, brain activity regarding spatial processing and attention (measured with EEG), performance, and user experience in male participants. Participants stacked cups according to given patterns using direct manipulation with horizontally flipped controls, similar to looking in a mirror while performing object manipulation in real life. In a between-subjects user study, we compared this novel interaction with a baseline where the participants completed the same task with regular controls. Although there was no significant main effect of group on the mental rotation and perspective taking/spatial orientation tests scores, within-group analysis indicated a trend toward an improvement in the mirror-reversed group in spatial orientation, while both groups showed a trend toward improvement in mental rotation. Participants in both groups got better at the task over time (their task completion durations decreased). EEG data revealed significant theta band power increase in the mirror-reversed group whereas there was no difference in the alpha band power between the two groups.

Such body transformations can have implications for patients with eating disorders, or persons with extreme body dissatisfaction (BD). Changes in BD, weight anxiety, or body image are theoretically linked to visual selective attention, which can be measured with eye tracking. In the present study, 43 women with high or low BD were immersed in animated body weight-manipulated self-avatars in VR. Before a brief mirror exposure with their self-avatars, they experienced synchronous visuomotor and visuo-tactile contingencies in VR to increase embodiment, delivered through small movement exercises with real-time animation from first-person perspective and passive haptics. In a crossover study design, self-avatar weight was manipulated (normal weight vs. overweight) in both groups (low BD vs. high BD), and subjective experience was assessed before and after exposure. In contrast to our hypotheses, BD was not affected by the self-avatar condition. Embodiment decreased during mirror exposure, possibly due to the avatars wearing head-mounted displays. Interestingly, disembodiment was stronger in women with low BD. Furthermore, eye tracking showed that participants with high BD looked longer at weight-related body parts when immersed in the overweight self-avatar, whereas participants with low BD looked longer at weight-related body parts when immersed in the normal weight self-avatar. Overall, the results support body-specific visual attention and suggest that particularly participants with low BD show stronger disembodiment during self-avatar mirror exposure, possibly alleviating momentary body experience.

Besides, using virtual reality headsets decreases pain through involving patients in a multidimensional space. Stitching causes the child to not cooperate due to the pain occurring during the procedure. Therefore, this study combined these two methods to investigate the effect of familiarization with stitching through virtual reality headset on children's pain intensity and parents' satisfaction during stitching. Materials and methods: The present study was a clinical trial. The statistical population consisted of 60 children aged 5-7 years with a cut in the limb or head. These children were selected by the convenience method and randomly allocated into two groups. Pain related to laceration was measured using Visual Analog Scale in both groups before the intervention. In the intervention group, virtual headset was used 1 to 3 minutes before stitching (playing 1 minute and 30 seconds animation containing how to stitch and getting familiar with the hospital environment). After the procedure, the child's pain intensity was measured again. Parents were asked to complete a parents' satisfaction questionnaire on pain management after stitching. Finally, the data were analyzed using SPSS V16. Results: The demographic data did not show any significant differences. The results showed a statistically significant difference between the pain intensity of children in the control (8.6±1.67) and intervention (3.97±3.21) groups (P=0.001). Parents' satisfaction (control 48.03±11.76 and intervention 68.83±8.67) with pain management also showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P=0.001). Conclusion: It seems that using virtual reality for the purpose of familiarization reduces the intensity of pain in children during stitching and increases parents' satisfaction. Therefore, it is recommended to use this method as a non-drug, safe, non-invasive, and cheap method. © 2023, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

We hypothesized that sickness symptoms such as nausea, eyestrain, and fatigue would reduce the users' capacity to pay attention to tasks completed in a virtual environment, and that this reduction in attention would be dynamically reflected in a decrease of the P3b amplitude while VR sickness was experienced. In a user study, participants were taken on a tour through a museum in VR along paths with varying amounts of rotation, shown previously to cause different levels of VR sickness. While paying attention to the virtual museum (the primary task), participants were asked to silently count tones of a different frequency (the secondary task). Control measurements for comparison against the VR sickness conditions were taken when the users were not wearing the Head-Mounted Display (HMD) and while they were immersed in VR but not moving through the environment. This exploratory study shows, across multiple analyses, that the effect mean amplitude of the P3b collected during the task is associated with both sickness severity measured after the task with a questionnaire (SSQ) and with the number of counting errors on the secondary task. Thus, VR sickness may impair attention and task performance, and these changes in attention can be tracked with ERP measures as they happen, without asking participants to assess their sickness symptoms in the moment.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174857808"

Yet, despite a number of proposed mechanisms it remains unclear whether the fixation itself is driving performance effects or is simply an emergent property of underpinning cognitions. Across two pre-registered studies, novice golfers (n = 127) completed a series of golf putts in a virtual reality simulation to examine the function of the quiet eye in the absence of visual information. In experiment 1 participants maintained a quiet eye fixation even when all visual information was occluded. Visual occlusion did significantly disrupt motor skill accuracy, but the effect was relatively small (89cm vs 105cm radial error, std. beta = 0.25). In experiment 2, a ‘noisy eye’ was induced using covertly moving fixation points, which disrupted skill execution (p = .04, BF = 318.07, std. beta = -0.25) even though visual input was equivalent across conditions. Overall, the results showed that performers persist with a long pre-shot fixation even in the absence of visual information, and that the stillness of this fixation confers a functional benefit that is not merely related to improved information extraction. © 2023 Harris et al.

In this paper, we especially focus on the use of 'dissimilar' avatars i.e., avatars diverging from the real appearance of the user, whether they preserve an anthropomorphic aspect or not. Previous studies reported that dissimilar avatars can positively impact the user experience, in terms for example of interaction, perception or behaviour. However, given the sparsity and multi-disciplinary character of research related to dissimilar avatars, it tends to lack common understanding and methodology, hampering the establishment of novel knowledge on this topic. In this paper, we propose to address these limitations by discussing: (i) a methodology for dissimilar avatars characterization, (ii) their impacts on the user experience, (iii) their different fields of application, and finally, (iv) future research direction on this topic. Taken together, we believe that this paper can support future research related to dissimilar avatars, and help designers of VR applications to leverage dissimilar avatars appropriately.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174815499"

While passive haptic devices are commonly used in virtual reality, they lack generality and are difficult to precisely generate continuous force feedback to users. In this work, we present SmartSpring, a new solution for passive haptics, which is inexpensive, lightweight and capable of providing controllable force feedback in virtual reality. We propose a hybrid spring-linkage structure as the proxy and flexibly control the mechanism for adjustable system stiffness. By analyzing the structure and force model, we enable a smart transform of the structure for producing continuous force signals. We quantitatively examine the real-world performance of SmartSpring to verify our model. By asymmetrically moving or actively pressing the end-effector, we show that our design can further support rendering torque and stiffness. Finally, we demonstrate the SmartSpring in a series of scenarios with user studies and a just noticeable difference analysis.

We compared the ability of people with PD and healthy older adults (OA) to integrate multi-sensory information during straight-line walking in response to visual and vestibular perturbations, using continuous translations of the visual surround and galvanic vestibular stimulation within a virtual reality environment. We measured their endpoint deviations from midline and changes in gait parameters. We found that people with PD deviated more than OA when walking in a dark environment but did not show differences in deviations when walking in a virtual room with visual information. With visual and vestibular perturbations, people with PD did not differ from OA in endpoint deviations nor variabilities. However, people with PD did not adopt a more cautious gait when GVS was applied in a virtual room, unlike OA. Overall, we showed that people with mild PD did not perform worse than OA but did show differences in gait patterns, suggesting that visual-vestibular integration is relatively preserved during gait in PD. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174462614"

Existing works have analyzed the effect of high-level cognitive tasks like memory or visual search on visual behavior; however, they have often done so with different stimuli, methodology, metrics and participants, which makes drawing conclusions and comparisons between tasks particularly difficult. In this work we present a systematic study of how different cognitive tasks affect visual behavior in a novel within-subjects design scheme. Participants performed free exploration, memory and visual search tasks in three different scenes while their eye and head movements were being recorded. We found significant, consistent differences between tasks in the distributions of fixations, saccades and head movements.

This article describes the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) in terms of upgraded workplace understanding, training, and assisting semi-skilled/new workers in an industrial production environment. The different modes of instruction visualization techniques are investigated for the execution of assembly tasks and explored their impact in accordance to the efficiency of task execution, completion time, error rate perception, cognitive load, and independence. Progress outcomes of 24 participants are explored for real-time execution of a Reverse osmosis (RO) booster pump assembly in terms of different modes of visualization, such as the conventional document method, virtual /desktop mode, and object mapping-based AR. Additionally, the user studies on different visualization devices involving hand-held visualization devices (HHVD) and Head-mounted visualization devices (HMVD) are investigated and validated in terms of adaptability, acceptability, and usability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the AR-aided object mapping technology versus other methods is explored through the feedback received from both experts and academia participants, which increases the insight of the technology and provides an intelligent mechanism for semi-skilled/new workers to handle complex or challenging operations in the production environment. The studies indicate that object mapping-based AR visualization facilitates increased assembly task efficiency and the minimum number of errors compared to the other guidance modes. Notably, the HMVD affords an increased realism experience, minimized errors, and less completion time compared to the HHVD. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174524909"

However, questions arise on the use of VR in multimodal postsurgical pain management. Optimizing VR for pain management requires an understanding of intervention- and context-specific factors, based on patients’ needs and expectations after major surgery. This substudy is part of a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of three VR interventions as an add-on, self-administered treatment for postsurgical pain. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to evaluate VR effects, software, hardware, prescriptions, and factors affecting the implementation of VR. Experiences across interventions were compared to identify relevant factors for successful implementation. Patients benefitted from self-administered VR in postsurgical pain management in various aspects and without serious drawbacks. Participants preferred an intuitive, 3D, 360-degree VR device with a large choice of applications matching their interests. The preferred frequency and duration of VR use was 2–3 sessions a day for 10–15 min each. Adjusting the VR use to individuals’ needs and contexts was reported to be key for successful implementation, with attention paid to improving the awareness of VR as a non-pharmacological means of promoting postsurgical recovery among patients and healthcare professionals. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176572847"

This has a greater impact on people with balance impairments since many rely more heavily on their visual cues to keep their balance. This is a significant obstacle to the universal usability and accessibility of VR. Although previous studies have verified the imbalance issue, not much work has been done to diminish it. In this study, we investigated how to increase VR balance by utilizing additional visual cues. To examine how different visual approaches (static, rhythmic, spatial, and center of pressure (CoP) based feedback) affect balance in VR, we recruited 100 people (50 with balance impairments due to multiple sclerosis and 50 without balance impairments) across two different geographic locations (United States and Bangladesh). All people completed both standing visual exploration as well as standing reach and grasp tasks. Results demonstrated that static, rhythmic, and CoP visual feedback approaches enhanced balance significantly (p <. 05) in VR for people with balance impairments. The methods described in this study could be applied to design more accessible virtual environments for people with balance impairments.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174837772"

The effectiveness of these roles can be greatly improved by integrating technology. These technologies, often grouped into two categories–agricultural technology and educational technology–work together to yield the best outcomes. While several studies have been conducted using technologies in agricultural extension programs, no previous reviews have solely examined the impact of these technologies in agricultural extension, and this leaves a significant knowledge gap especially for professionals in this field. For this scoping review, we searched the five most relevant, reliable, and comprehensive databases (CAB Abstracts (Ovid), AGRICOLA (EBSCO), ERIC (EBSCO), Education Source (EBSCO), and Web of Science Core Collection) for articles focused on the use of technology for training farmers in agricultural extension settings. Fifty-four studies published between 2000 and 2022 on the use of technology in agricultural extension programs were included in this review. Our findings show that: (1) most studies were conducted in the last seven years (2016–2022) in the field of agronomy, with India being the most frequent country and Africa being the most notable region for the studies; (2) the quantitative research method was the most employed, while most of the included studies used more than one data collection approach; (3) multimedia was the most widely used educational technology, while most of the studies combined more than one agricultural technology such as pest and disease control, crop cultivation and harvesting practices; (4) the impacts of technology in agricultural extension were mostly mixed, while only the educational technology type had a statistically significant effect or impact of the intervention outcome. From an analysis of the results, we identified potential limitations in included studies’ methodology and reporting that should be considered in the future like the need to further analyze the specific interactions between the two technology types and their impacts of some aspects of agricultural extension. We also looked at the characteristics of interventions, the impact of technology on agricultural extension programs, and current and future trends. We emphasized the gaps in the literature that need to be addressed. © 2023 Xu et al.

However, despite extensive research on the self-similarity effect in single-user VR environments, our understanding of its impact in social VR settings remains underdeveloped. This shortfall exists despite the unique socio-psychological phenomena arising from the illusion of embodiment that could potentially alter these effects. To fill this gap, this paper provides an in-depth empirical investigation of how avatars' self-similarity influences social VR experiences. Our research uncovers several notable findings: 1) A high level of avatar self-similarity boosts users' sense of embodiment and social presence but has minimal effects on the overall presence and even slightly hinders immersion. These results are driven by increased self-awareness. 2) Among various factors that contribute to the self-similarity of avatars, voice stands out as a significant influencer of social VR experiences, surpassing other representational factors. 3) The impact of avatar self-similarity shows negligible differences between male and female users. Based on these findings, we discuss the pros and cons of incorporating self-similarity into social VR avatars.

Prior research showed that such displays provide a wide field of view and offer users a high level of immersion. However, little is known about users' performance (e.g., pointing speed and accuracy) on them. We explore users' pointing performance on large virtual curved displays. We investigate standard pointing factors (e.g., target width and amplitude) in combination with relevant curve-related factors, namely display curvature and both linear and angular measures. Our results show that the less curved the display, the higher the performance, i.e., faster movement time. This result holds for pointing tasks controlled via their visual properties (linear widths and amplitudes) or their motor properties (angular widths and amplitudes). Additionally, display curvatures significantly affect the error rate for both linear and angular conditions. Furthermore, we observe that curved displays perform better or similar to flat displays based on throughput analysis. Finally, we discuss our results and provide suggestions regarding pointing tasks on large curved displays in VR.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174798345"

Thus, distinguishing the differences in emotional needs between genders by considering color psychology is necessary to establish a scientific evaluation model and, ultimately, design a gender-oriented façade color. This study extracts a typical space-combination prototype as an experiment given the context of block renewal in China. Based on multiple case studies, 16 color schemes were incorporated into this prototype, and a cognitive semantic scale for architectural colors was developed and established. This study used a combination of virtual reality technology and questionnaires to conduct color-perception experiments with 72 college students (36 males and 36 females). Subsequently, participants' preferences for façade colors were assessed using questionnaires. Finally, a comparative analysis of data on the respondents' color perception results revealed gender differences in interest in façade colors within the same spatial environment. Depression, darkness, and heaviness have similar meanings in the perceptual evaluation of façade colors in China; females' identification of perceived similarities among the three common factors was more prominent than males’. Regarding preferences for urban façade colors, females preferred schemes that combined base and accent colors, with the base color accounting for approximately 95 % of the total façade color. Males, on the other hand, had no particular preference for this pattern. Regardless of gender, both males and females preferred urban façade color schemes that lean towards bright and warm tones. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174160423"

Despite the benefits, it has not been widely adopted. Demographics and user personalities play a large role in technology adoption, but nonusers’ involvement is often overlooked. Considering the current attention on FAV technology and its users, pedestrians (who do not use it) are understudied. In future, FAVs may be deployed once they have been proven safe and accepted by the public. This study aimed to provide insights into how pedestrians’ emotional perceptions might influence their adoption of FAVs. Within-subject research was conducted using virtual reality-based videos to assess pedestrians’ perceptions of stress. Videos showed identical first-person-view walking scenarios of various spatial contexts and activities in urban transportation networks comprising all-human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and futuristic all-FAVs. The results indicated that pedestrians’ perceptions of stress differed significantly by vehicle type, spatial context, and activity. Further, they differed significantly by gender and whether walking was perceived as safe. Walking in all-FAV transportation systems was perceived as more stressful than walking in all-HDV systems. Women tended to report higher levels of stress. Crossing roads and shared pathways were also associated with higher levels of perceived stress. Research related to pedestrians’ emotional perceptions could have important implications for future policymaking and urban planning. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175527288"

Observations of actual polling stations located in schools in Israel revealed a strong presence of nationalist and religious content in and around voting booths, in the form of naïve décor such as murals and children's drawings (Study 1). In three experimental studies (Studies 2–4), we examine the effect on voters of such seemingly apolitical cues. The experimental studies were conducted in the days prior to Israeli general elections for the 21st and 22nd Knesset. Using a virtual-reality interface based on real-life content in actual polling stations (Study 2, student sample) and simulated environments (Studies 3 and 4, representative samples of Jewish Israeli voters), the three experiments document an effect of naïve nationalist décor on simulated voting, particularly for left-wing less-nationalist voters. In Study 5, based on actual voting in the 22nd Knesset, we capitalize on the random allocation of voters to polling stations in schools and find a correlation between the content displayed around polling places and voting patterns among distinctively left-wing populations. Investigating the influence of the encounter with the immediate environment at a resolution of meters and seconds exposes the potential impact of the (ultra-)micro temporo-spatial scale on decision-making and enriches theoretical discussions on the multiscalarity of contexts in electoral geography analyses. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171568869"

It fashions engaging spaces for user interaction that simulate the real world by integrating augmented and virtual reality. Metaverse furnishes immersive interactive experiences, unrestricted time and space, visualizations, minimal learning costs, and endorses communication. A metaverse offers various services, such as virtual environments and avatars for telecommuting, education, and gaming. Yet, to access services, users must register with the server, where the registration requires user's identity, password, and personal information. Additionally, the user interaction in metaverse is mediated through avatars over public channels, fabricating opportunities for security attacks such as replay and impersonation attacks. Consequently, we propose a secure mutual authentication scheme for safer user-server and avatar–avatar interactions utilizing Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and fuzzy extractor. The security of protocol is examined with Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic, Real-or-Random (ROR) model, and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols Applications (AVISPA). We also conduct a comparative analysis of the computational and communication costs and the security features of proposed scheme with pre-existing works. Hence, the suggested protocol offers magnificent security and efficiency, making it suitable for the metaverse environment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173163734"

The application of surgical navigation systems can significantly improve the safety and accuracy of implantation. However, the frequent shift of the views of the surgeon between the surgical site and the computer screen causes troubles, which is expected to be solved by the introduction of mixed-reality technology through the wearing of HoloLens devices by enabling the alignment of the virtual three-dimensional (3D) image with the actual surgical site in the same field of view. Methods: This study utilized mixed reality technology to enhance dental implant surgery navigation. Our first step was reconstructing a virtual 3D model from pre-operative cone-beam CT (CBCT) images. We then obtained the relative position between objects using the navigation device and HoloLens camera. Via the algorithms of virtual-actual registration, the transformation matrixes between the HoloLens devices and the navigation tracker were acquired through the HoloLens-tracker registration, and the transformation matrixes between the virtual model and the patient phantom through the image-phantom registration. In addition, the algorithm of surgical drill calibration assisted in acquiring transformation matrixes between the surgical drill and the patient phantom. These algorithms allow real-time tracking of the surgical drill's location and orientation relative to the patient phantom under the navigation device. With the aid of the HoloLens 2, virtual 3D images and actual patient phantoms can be aligned accurately, providing surgeons with a clear visualization of the implant path. Results: Phantom experiments were conducted using 30 patient phantoms, with a total of 102 dental implants inserted. Comparisons between the actual implant paths and the pre-operatively planned implant paths showed that our system achieved a coronal deviation of 1.507 ± 0.155 mm, an apical deviation of 1.542 ± 0.143 mm, and an angular deviation of 3.468 ± 0.339°. The deviation was not significantly different from that of the navigation-guided dental implant placement but better than the freehand dental implant placement. Conclusion: Our proposed system realizes the integration of the pre-operative planned dental implant paths and the patient phantom, which helps surgeons achieve adequate accuracy in traditional dental implant surgery. Furthermore, this system is expected to be applicable to animal and cadaveric experiments in further studies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173626348"

But how exactly do our intentions surface in the visible communicative behavior we display? Here we focus on pointing gestures, a fundamental building block of everyday communication, and investigate whether and how different types of underlying intent modulate the kinematics of the pointing hand and the brain activity preceding the gestural movement. In a dynamic virtual reality environment, participants pointed at a referent to either share attention with their addressee, inform their addressee, or get their addressee to perform an action. Behaviorally, it was observed that these different underlying intentions modulated how long participants kept their arm and finger still, both prior to starting the movement and when keeping their pointing hand in apex position. In early planning stages, a neurophysiological distinction was observed between a gesture that is used to share attitudes and knowledge with another person versus a gesture that mainly uses that person as a means to perform an action. Together, these findings suggest that our intentions influence our actions from the earliest neurophysiological planning stages to the kinematic endpoint of the movement itself. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167603790"

Players in VREs can choose to create representative avatars. Such choices may reflect beliefs related to identity and psychological functioning. The aim of the present study was to examine associations between psychological distress, exposure to adverse childhood experiences, and choice of avatar in an immersive virtual environment. Methods: We recruited 436 participants in a VRE. Participants completed the Early Traumatic Inventory Self Report-Short Form and the Brief Symptom Inventory. We evaluated between-group differences (selection of child avatar, parent avatar, or “other” avatar, the control group) in psychological distress and traumatic childhood experiences. Results: Individuals who selected child avatars experienced a higher degree of psychological distress and childhood trauma, especially sexual abuse, as compared to individuals who selected other avatars. Individuals who selected parent avatars were more likely to have experienced psychological distress as compared to controls. Discussion: Avatar choice may reflect users’ identities and psychological functioning. VREs may provide safe environments for a “do over” of adverse childhood experiences. Future research should explore VREs as venues to treat trauma and psychological distress. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171537852"

This paper introduces a robust approach employing deep reinforcement learning theory to facilitate informed collision avoidance decisions within intricate maritime environments. The restrictions on USV maneuverability and international regulations for preventing collisions at sea are studied and quantified, particularly focusing on the shape and size changes of the ship's domain caused by USV speed. Based on the deep Q network, an improved methodology is designed, incorporating a noisy network, prioritized experience replay, dueling neural network architecture, and double Q learning, resulting in a highly efficient sampling, exploration, and learning process. To curtail computational expenses associated with USVs, a novel dynamic area restriction technique is proposed. Furthermore, an innovative USV state clipping method is introduced to mitigate training complexities. By utilizing the Unity platform, a virtual environment characterized by complexity and stochasticity is constructed for training and testing the collision avoidance of USVs This novel approach surpasses the performance of the pre-improvement algorithm across multiple collision avoidance effectiveness indicators and performance metrics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172872833"

One important problem of the VR technology is how to securely interact with users, in particular, implementing secure text input. A promising approach is to use a virtual keyboard rendered as a VR object. The VR user can enter certain text by clicking a sequence of virtual keys through the VR controllers, and the input text is handled in a secure way. However, despite the sensitivity of the input text, we found that there is a critical vulnerability that the VR controllers are not properly protected. The VR controller status can be disclosed to malicious entities, imposing a severe threat that an attacker's website can infer the input text by eavesdropping and analyzing the VR controller's movements. To accurately infer the input, the attacker should address two challenges: 1) determining which clicks correspond to the virtual keyboard and 2) identifying which key is pressed. In this paper, we propose a new keystroke inference attack framework, VRKeyLogger, that addresses such challenges with two key components: key-click classifier and key-click identifier. The key-click classifier effectively distinguishes clicks on the virtual keyboard based on the SVM classifier trained by the major features of the VR controller uses. The key-click identifier then accurately identifies which key is pressed by transforming the clicked position into the local coordinate system of the virtual keyboard. We implemented a proof-of-concept prototype and conducted a user study with nine participants. In the extensive user study with three real-world WebVR applications, our VRKeyLogger results in classification and identification accuracy of 93.98 and 96.8% on average, respectively. This implies that the proposed attack poses a serious threat to WebVR security. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170645712"

Key terms included “dementia,” “family caregivers,” and “simulation.” To broaden reference retrieval, “empathy” was not used as a key term but remained an inclusion criterion during reference screening. Data extraction of relevant references was completed. Results: The search yielded 212 citations. Seven eligible dementia simulation studies were identified, including 1 randomized controlled trial, 3 quasi-experimental studies, and 3 qualitative research studies. Only 3 of the 7 studies focused specifically on family caregivers of persons with dementia. Conclusions: Qualitative data supported increased empathy in family caregivers, but quantitative findings on changes in empathy levels were inconclusive. Further research using quantitative or mixed-methods designs is necessary to support benefits of simulation on empathy for family caregivers of persons with dementia. © The Author(s) 2023.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172710066"

The social nature of the Metaverse opens new ways for immersive social interactions that combine the strengths of physical and virtual worlds. This scenario creates new possibilities for social interactions that can worsen problems like the Echo chamber or the information cocoon effects. In this work, we devise a virtual and real blending network environment and introduce the concern vector indicator to explore the equilibrium of individual concern-critical influence maximization (EIC-cIM). We compute the complexity of the EIC-cIM and verify the modularity of the objective function. A surrogate objective function is introduced to tackle the problem of the EIC-cIM. We exploit the continuous relaxation technique to develop an approximate projected subgradient algorithm, which effectively guarantees the balance of individual concern in the information diffusion process. The experimental simulations on three network data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and the experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing heuristic algorithms by at least 23% in performance and even outperforms the max-greedy algorithm in some cases. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169839377"

In universities, the situation is complicated as campuses need to have a high level of comfort and, therefore, consume more energy than other building types. Lighting accounts for a high percentage of this energy expenditure and urgent measures are required to reduce this consumption and, thus, costs. A further complication is that lighting has been shown to have an important influence on cognitive learning processes. One such process is memory, which has a fundamental influence on modern society. In this study, we analyse the psychological responses of 143 students in a memory task in a virtual classroom using three illuminance levels (100 lx, 300 lx and 500 lx) and four colour temperatures (3000 K, 4000 K, 6500 K and 10500 K). The results showed that lighting conditions influence memory. The combination of 100 lx and 6500 K produced the best memory performance. The results showed that varying lighting parameters can significantly reduce the energy expenditure of educational centres and, in turn, provide better cognitive outcomes for students. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171765386"

The single element of the proposed MIMO is a 3 × 3 element planar binomial series-fed array whose width of the radiating elements is tapered to achieve the binomial distribution. From both simulated and tested results, it is observed that a wider bandwidth (S11 < –10 dB of 21.78 %), high peak gain (12.4 dBi), and high radiation efficiency (92 %) with side lobe level (SLL) reduction of more than 9 dB are achieved by additional loaded patches. This design approach does not only offer wider bandwidth, low SLL, and gain increment, but also ensures the excellent diversity performances of the very closely spaced (0.116λ) MIMO antenna, without utilizing any additional decoupling structure. The proposed MIMO antenna system offers impedance bandwidth (S11 < − 10 dB) from 24.6 GHz to 30.59 GHz, isolation > 27 dB, envelope correlation coefficient < 0.0002, diversity gain > 9.99 dB, and mean effective gain between –4 dB and –8 dB.

However, ARK is limited in mostly enabling experimentation with a single swarm. In this letter, we introduce M-ARK, a system to support studies on multi-swarm interaction. M-ARK is based on the synchronisation over a network connection of multiple ARK systems, whether real or simulated, serving a twofold purpose: i) to study the interaction of multiple, possibly heterogeneous swarms, and ii) to enable a gradual transition from simulation to reality. Moreover, M-ARK enables the interaction between swarms dislocated across multiple labs worldwide, encouraging scientific collaboration and advancement in multi-swarm interaction studies. © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171525612"

We developed a new brief automated virtual reality (VR) cognitive treatment that has the potential to be used easily in clinical services. We aimed to compare VR cognitive therapy with an alternative VR therapy (mental relaxation), with an emphasis on understanding potential mechanisms of action. Methods: THRIVE was a parallel-group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial across four UK National Health Service trusts in England. Participants were included if they were aged 16 years or older, had a persistent (at least 3 months) persecutory delusion held with at least 50% conviction, reported feeling threatened when outside with other people, and had a primary diagnosis from the referring clinical team of a non-affective psychotic disorder. We randomly assigned (1:1) patients to either THRIVE VR cognitive therapy or VR mental relaxation, using a permuted blocks algorithm with randomly varying block size, stratified by severity of delusion. Usual care continued for all participants. Each VR therapy was provided in four sessions over approximately 4 weeks, supported by an assistant psychologist or clinical psychologist. Trial assessors were masked to group allocation. Outcomes were assessed at 0, 2 (therapy mid-point), 4 (primary endpoint, end of treatment), 8, 16, and 24 weeks. The primary outcome was persecutory delusion conviction, assessed by the Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scale (PSYRATS; rated 0–100%). Outcome analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. We assessed the treatment credibility and expectancy of the interventions and the two mechanisms (defence behaviours and safety beliefs) that the cognitive intervention was designed to target. This trial is prospectively registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN12497310. Findings: From Sept 21, 2018, to May 13, 2021 (with a pause due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions from March 16, 2020, to Sept 14, 2020), we recruited 80 participants with persistent persecutory delusions (49 [61%] men, 31 [39%] women, with a mean age of 40 years [SD 13, range 18–73], 64 [80%] White, six [8%] Black, one [1%] Indian, three [4%] Pakistani, and six [8%] other race or ethnicity). We randomly assigned 39 (49%) participants assigned to VR cognitive therapy and 41 (51%) participants to VR mental relaxation. 33 (85%) participants who were assigned to VR cognitive therapy attended all four sessions, and 35 (85%) participants assigned to VR mental relaxation attended all four sessions. We found no significant differences between the two VR interventions in participant ratings of treatment credibility (adjusted mean difference –1·55 [95% CI –3·68 to 0·58]; p=0·15) and outcome expectancy (–0·91 [–3·42 to 1·61]; p=0·47). 77 (96%) participants provided follow-up data at the primary timepoint. Compared with VR mental relaxation, VR cognitive therapy did not lead to a greater improvement in persecutory delusions (adjusted mean difference –2·16 [–12·77 to 8·44]; p=0·69). Compared with VR mental relaxation, VR cognitive therapy did not lead to a greater reduction in use of defence behaviours (adjusted mean difference –0·71 [–4·21 to 2·79]; p=0·69) or a greater increase in belief in safety (–5·89 [–16·83 to 5·05]; p=0·29). There were 17 serious adverse events unrelated to the trial (ten events in seven participants in the VR cognitive therapy group and seven events in five participants in the VR mental relaxation group). Interpretation: The two VR interventions performed similarly, despite the fact that they had been designed to affect different mechanisms. Both interventions had high uptake rates and were associated with large improvements in persecutory delusions but it cannot be determined that the treatments accounted for the change. Immersive technologies hold promise for the treatment of severe mental health problems. However, their use will likely benefit from experimental research on the application of different therapeutic techniques and the effects on a range of potential mechanisms of action.

The current computer-based rehabilitation training ignores the role of emotions in cognitive impairment rehabilitation, making it difficult to improve patient engagement and efficiency. To address this, a psychodynamics-based cognitive rehabilitation training method with personalized emotional arousal elements was proposed using virtual reality technology. Methods: Our proposed method contains four training tasks, which cover (audiovisual memory, attention & processing, working memory, abstract & Logic, spatial pathfinding) and six positive emotional arousal elements (sensory feedback, achievement system, multiplayer interaction, score comparison, relaxation scenarios, and peaceful videos) to motivate participants to persist during cognitive training continuously and maintain a positive mental attitude toward training. The six emotional arousal elements were divided into two personalized combinations—full combination and half combination—based on the results of the pre-assessment and were dynamically distributed throughout both the training tasks and post-training. Results: Fifteen participants with MCI were recruited to complete the proposed experiment and validate the effectiveness of the system. They were first asked to complete two assessments (e.g., the big five scale and the positive and negative affect scale) to investigate their personalities. Based on the results of the assessments, they were provided with a full or half combination of arousal elements in the training tasks and post-training. Finally, the acceptability of the system and task experience were assessed using questionnaires. Notably, there was a significant increase in training scores for participants who completed a six-week training period (66.7%, 33.4%, and 25.0% for attention and processing, working memory, and abstraction and logic, respectively). The results show that positive emotional arousal had a positive effect on the MCI participants. The training tasks and arousal elements can improve cognitive function and enhance the confidence and engagement of participants. There were no significant differences in cognitive domain training scores between the two groups. Conclusions: This personalized cognitive training system has the potential to serve as a convenient solution for complementary treatment of MCI. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170027098"

To investigate the effects of different types of street vegetation on people’s stress recovery, this study used virtual reality technology to establish five street scenes with different vegetation types, including a non-vegetated street, a street with trees, a street with trees and grass, a street with trees and hedges, and a street with trees, grass, and flowers. Twenty-four participants completed the Trier Social Stress Test and then watched the five street scenes for stress recovery. Participants rated the vegetated streets as significantly better at reducing stress than the non-vegetated street. Compared with the non-vegetated street, the participants’ POMS scores decreased by 2.59–12.09 and ROS scores increased by 0.83–3.67 after watching the vegetated streets, indicating significant improvement in mood (P < 0.001). HRV data showed that the combination of trees, grass, and flowers was the most effective for stress recovery (LF/HF = 0.67 ± 0.42; pNN50 = 27.41% ± 16.32%). EEG data showed that participants’ alpha power was 0.05–0.66 µV2 higher and mental stress scores based on brainwave power were 0.23–0.37 points lower in the vegetated streets than in the non-vegetated street. The occipital and frontal regions showed the most positive responses to changes in vegetation elements, and alpha brainwaves in the O2 channel were the most active. Therefore, the streets with vegetation were more conducive to stress recovery than the non-vegetated street.

E-commerce practitioners have used VR to improve business performance and satisfy consumers' needs by enhancing the shopping experience and increasing purchase intention. To explore the effects of VR shopping platforms on purchase intention, this study developed a theoretical framework on the basis of task–technology fit. The framework comprises technological characteristics and user needs (intrinsic and extrinsic motivation) and can be used to investigate perceived needs–technology fit and identify factors affecting intention to purchase on VR platforms. This study distributed an online questionnaire and received 336 responses. Analysis was performed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results suggested that purchase intention is stronger when perceived needs–technology fit is closer. Hedonic needs play a vital role in perceived needs–technology fit. In terms of technological characteristics, relative advantage, and service compatibility strongly affect perceived needs–technology fit. In addition, feelings of spatial presence, a key component of VR, positively affect relative advantage, service compatibility, and trialability and negatively affect complexity. The implications of the findings are also discussed. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167349880"

The adopted connectivity scheme must consider HDT-specific requirements including privacy, security, accuracy and the overall connectivity cost. This paper presents a new, secure, privacy-preserving and efficient human-To-virtual twin connectivity scheme for HDT by integrating three key techniques: differential privacy, federated multi-Task learning and blockchain. Specifically, we adopt federated multi-Task learning, a personalized learning method capable of providing higher accuracy, to capture the impact of heterogeneous environments. Next, we propose a new validation process based on the quality of trained models during the federated multi-Task learning process to guarantee accurate and authorized model evolution in the virtual environment. The proposed framework accelerates the learning process without sacrificing accuracy, privacy and communication costs which, we believe, are non-negotiable requirements of HDT networks. Finally, we compare the proposed connectivity scheme with related solutions and show that the proposed scheme can enhance security, privacy and accuracy while reducing the overall connectivity cost.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169675205"

This impact results in pressure waves that propagate through tissues, potentially causing life-threatening damage. To date, there is no standardized procedure for rapid virtual testing of the effectiveness of BPP designs. The objective of this study was to develop a novel, anatomically-accurate, finite element modeling framework, as a decision-making tool to evaluate and rate the biomechanical efficacy of BPPs in protecting the torso from battlefield-acquired non-penetrating impacts. Methods: To simulate a blunt impact with a BPP, two types of BPPs representing generic designs of threat-level III and IV plates, and a generic 5.56 mm bullet were modeled, based on their real dimensions, physical and mechanical characteristics (plate level-III is smaller, thinner, and lighter than plate level-IV). The model was validated by phantom testing. Results: Plate level-IV induced greater strains and stresses in the superficial tissues post the ballistic impact, due to the fact that it is larger, thicker and heavier than plate level-III; the shock wave which is transferred to the superficial tissues behind the BPP is greater in the case of a non-penetrating impact. For example - the area under volumetric tissue exposure histograms of strains and stresses for the skin and adipose tissues were 16.6–19.2% and 17.3–20.3% greater in the case of plate level-IV, for strains and stresses, respectively. The validation demonstrates a strong agreement between the physical phantom experiment and the simulation, with only a 6.37% difference between them. Conclusions: Our modelling provides a versatile, powerful testing framework for both industry and clients of BPPs at the prototype design phase, or for quantitative standardized evaluations of candidate products in purchasing decisions and bids. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171862048"

Data Sources: Electronic databases and clinical registers were searched until June 21, 2023. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO before the data extraction (CRD42023434340). Methods of Study Selection: We included RCTs of patients receiving VRT compared with controls receiving routine care during outpatient hysteroscopy. Tabulation, Integration, and Results: The primary outcome was average pain during hysteroscopy. Pooled results were expressed as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Sources of heterogeneity were investigated through sensitivity and subgroups analysis. Five RCTs were included (435 participants). The comparison between the intervention and control groups showed a borderline difference in perceived pain during hysteroscopy (MD −0.88, 95% CI −1.77 to 0.01). Subgroup analysis based on the type of VRT (active or passive) indicated that active VRT potentially reduced the perception of pain (MD −1.42, 95% CI −2.21 to −0.62), whereas passive VRT had no effect (MD −0.06, 95% CI −1.15 to 1.03). Conclusion: Patients’ use of active VRT may be associated with a reduction in pain during outpatient hysteroscopy (evidence Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation 2/4).

Our results extend previous studies showing that emotional responses are evoked in virtual environments (Meuleman and Rudrauf, 2018) and arouse the sense of empathy (Ventura et al., 2020). To this end, we built a virtual museum, where different avatars can interact with experimental subjects to discuss emotional and value-driven interpretations related to artworks, aiming at bootstrapping user's interpretation-reflection loops (IRL) (Daga et al., 2022). IRL consists in encouraging the user to (a) provide a point of view, (b) to know about another point of view, and (c) to possibly take a different perspective. In line with recent literature, our results are based on the analysis of dialogue, and on the psychophysiological response of the users, showing that a VR-driven methodology can both develop a sense of embodiment, and maximize the human capacity to take another's point of view. Results also confirm that the use of immersive VR can be a valid tool to promote empathy through an embodied experience. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167836126"

The purpose of this study was to determine if baseline skills of residents on a virtual reality (VR) robotic simulator before intern year predicted future performance in a proficiency-based curriculum. Methods: Across two academic years, 21 general surgery PGY-1s underwent the robotic surgery boot camp at the University of Texas Southwestern. During boot camp, subjects completed five previously validated VR tasks, and their performance metrics (score, time, and economy of motion [EOM]) were extracted retrospectively from their Intuitive learning accounts. The same metrics were assessed during their residency until they reached previously validated proficiency benchmarks. Outcomes were defined as the score at proficiency, attempts to reach proficiency, and time to proficiency. Spearman’s rho and Mann–Whitney U tests were used; median (IQR) was reported. Significance level was set at p < 0.05. Results: Twenty-one residents completed at least three out of the five boot camp tasks and achieved proficiency in the former during residency. The median average score at boot camp was 12.3 (IQR: 5.14–18.5). The median average EOM at boot camp was 599.58 cm (IQR: 529.64–676.60). The average score at boot camp significantly correlated with lower time to achieve proficiency (p < 0.05). EOM at boot camp showed a significant correlation with attempts to proficiency and time to proficiency (p < 0.01). Residents with an average baseline EOM below the median showed a significant difference in attempts to proficiency (p < 0.05) and time to proficiency (p < 0.05) compared to those with EOMs above or equal to the median. Conclusion: Residents with an innate ability to perform tasks with better EOM may acquire robotic surgery skills faster. Future investigators could explore how these innate differences impact performance throughout residency.

Delamination and ply degradation information were mapped to a compression model, with a maximum stress criterion, using python scripts. Experimental data, in which artificial lightning strike and compression testing were performed, was used to assess the predictive capabilities of the framework, considering three lightning strike peak current amplitudes (25, 50, and 75 kA).

This paper focuses on a postprocessing technique for the photogrammetry step, mostly for outdoor environments that cannot be reconstructed using an unmanned aerial vehicle. As visualization applications (including VR) need a 3D model with a known vertical direction, a method is introduced to compute it. The method is based on 3D principal component analysis and a 2D Hough transform. In the experiments, we first reconstruct both man-made and natural immersive environments using a helmet-held 360 camera, then we import the 3D models in good coordinate systems (i.e. with a vertical axis and a plausible scale) into Unity, and finally we use VR headsets to explore the scenes like a pedestrian.

Methods and Materials: Three disease site-specific (breast, pelvis, head and neck) VR videos were filmed using a 360-degree camera to portray the first-person perspective of a patient's standard RT appointments, including a computed tomography simulation and the first RT treatment session. Instruction is given for possible clinical implementation. Patient participation was divided into 2 groups: (1) Group A (n = 28) included patients participating before simulation and later after the first treatment, and (2) Group B (n = 33) included patients participating only while undergoing treatment. Patients viewed their disease site-specific video using an inexpensive cardboard VR viewer and their smartphone, emulating an expensive VR-headset. Surveys were administered assessing patient anxiety, comfort, satisfaction, and knowledge of RT on a 5-point Likert-type scale. Results: Patients in Group A and Group B while undergoing treatment both indicated that their anxiety “decreased a little” in the survey, after watching the VR video (Group A, median on a 5-point Likert-type scale, 4 [IQR, 4-5]; Group B, 4 [IQR, 4-4]). The VR aspect of the videos was especially liked by patients while undergoing treatment, with 96.4% in Group A and 90.9% in Group B reporting that the VR aspect of the videos was helpful. All Group A participants believed that the VR videos would be beneficial to new patients.

Informal dementia caregivers are particularly vulnerable, as many are older adults themselves and at elevated risk of adverse mental and physical health outcomes. Technology-based interventions could offer accessible, affordable, and convenient solutions. A previous review included Internet-based supportive interventions for informal dementia caregivers published up to 2013; however, new publications, technological advances, and targeted outcomes justify conducting this scoping review. Here, we identified and synthesized recent technology-based interventions that addressed social isolation and loneliness among informal dementia caregivers. Design: Scoping review. Setting and Participants: Informal dementia caregivers in the community. Methods: Following Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework, we conducted a systematic search of peer-reviewed studies across 6 databases within the last 11 years, including identifying research questions, selecting relevant studies, charting data, and summarizing results. Results: From the 2937 articles identified, 10 eligible studies were included in this review. The intervention type, format, and duration varied widely. Three categories of interventions to address social isolation and loneliness among informal dementia caregivers included technology-assisted peer support, newly developed Web-based multicomponent psychoeducational programs and platforms, and virtual adaptation and modification of existing programs. Predominantly qualitative evidence suggests that technology-based interventions have the potential to reduce feelings of loneliness and improve caregiver well-being. Quantitative evidence tends to be preliminary and inconclusive. Conclusions and Implications: The findings offer preliminary evidence for technology-based interventions to reduce or prevent social isolation and loneliness in informal dementia caregivers. Technology-based interventions addressing social isolation and loneliness in informal dementia caregivers have the potential to overcome barriers to low uptake of services and withdrawal from interventions and improve the sustainability of the interventions. In the long run, by reducing or preventing social isolation and loneliness in informal dementia caregivers, the transition from home care to facility-based care might be delayed. © 2023","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171637755"

In this study, brightness perception threshold (BPT) experiments with controlled, repeatable conditions were conducted in equivalent real and VR environments using the minimum change method. The experiments were conducted with the luminance, shape, size, and position of the light-emitting surfaces as variables, using 20 distinct surface forms. After 28 participants finished the assessment, the experimental data were analyzed using SPSS. The analysis shows that the initial luminance, shape, and size all have significant influence on the BPT in both real and VR environments, and the influence rules are consistent. The effect of the positions of the light-emitting surfaces on the BPT varies depending on the shape. Based on the BPT data, the Number of Perceptions (NOP) was proposed as an intermediate variable, and 15 brightness calibration curves for VR and real environment light sources were established. This study uses the consistency of visual brightness to establish the correspondence between the VR presentations’ brightness and the physical illumination of real scenes, which has implications for improving the accuracy of VR applications to light environment research and design. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170226663"

However, traditional methods of flood computation and visualization often suffer from poor timeliness and subpar visualization effects, particularly in virtual reality (VR) scenarios. Panoramic data, inherently suitable for VR visualization, offers a low data volume attribute that significantly reduces the time cost of data processing. This allows for the real-time overlay of flood simulation results with the actual environment. We proposed a multi-scale flood simulation method which is subsequently integrated with panoramic images or videos through a dimensionality reduction process, enhancing visualization effects. We developed a prototype system to validate the proposed methodology, and the results demonstrated improved visualization outcomes, rendering efficiency, and user experience in VR panoramic flood simulations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169803059"

In this study, we examined whether modified navigation instructions can make pedestrians less reliant on navigation aids to solve wayfinding tasks. In contrast to standard instructions, the modified instructions make decision-relevant landmarks at intersections emotionally salient and connected through narrative, and thus more memorable. The results of our online VR study with seventy adults revealed that, after navigating an unfamiliar route using modified navigation instructions, people made significantly fewer references to the navigation aid without compromising the accuracy of navigation compared to standard instructions. Narrative-based navigation instructions improved memory for the order in which relevant features in the environment were encountered along the traversed route, but not landmark recognition memory or memory for landmark-direction associations. Our findings highlight the benefits of using human-centred technologies that – as opposed to current navigation systems – promote the encoding and memorability of spatial information during navigation, and have the potential to train human spatial navigation abilities in the long term as a countermeasure toward GPS cognitive deskilling of population. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173449632"

To this end, this paper studies the problem of fixed-time cruise control for VCTS. To begin with, by analyzing the dynamic evolution of the VCTS in an actual environment, a second-order VCTS train-following dynamic model is formulated with considering actuator faults, uncertain resistance, unknown disturbances, and control input saturation. Then, an improved barrier functions-based fixed-time sliding model control method is proposed to deal with the state constraints (i.e., safe distance and speed limit). To deal with parametric uncertainty, adaptive fault-tolerant control and core function technologies are integrated into the same framework. Furthermore, by using a function approximation method to handle the control input saturation, an adaptive fault-tolerant fixed-time cruise controller is designed which not only guarantees the fixed-time stability of the VCTS but also copes with parametric uncertainty, state constraints, and input saturation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in simulation analysis. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173041808"

This study aimed to investigate the effects of implanted wood components in indoor informal learning spaces on restorative quality and the main mediators of the degree of wood configuration on restoration likelihood. Taking the library's leisure discussion area as the space carrier, students were recruited to experience virtual reality (VR) in ten kinds of spaces with different wood-component implantation schemes and conduct a restorative perceptual evaluation. First, the restorative perception of the space implanted with the wood structure and wood enclosure components was stronger than that of the space implanted only with wood enclosure components, especially when the wood rate exceeded 60%. The wood-component implantation scheme with the highest restorative score was as follows: the wood rate was in the range of 60–80%, with wood beams, wood columns, wood floor, wood roof, and wood walls being implanted simultaneously. Second, when the wood rate was below 80%, the restorative quality was substantially improved by increasing the wood rates and wood-application positions on the space surface. The restorative quality slowly decreased when the wood rate exceeded 80%. Finally, fascination, compatibility, naturalness, and preference mediated the effects of the degree of wood configuration on judgements of the restoration likelihood. Among them, the mediating effect generated through naturalness and preference was relatively large. Our research results provide wood-application guidance for the design and renewal of healthy indoor informal learning spaces in colleges, providing a reference for future research on the restoration of wood spaces. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173517994"

Over the last few years, mainstream computer architectures were extended with hardware virtualization support, giving rise to a set of virtualization technologies (e.g., Intel VT and Arm VE) that are now proliferating in modern processors and systems on chip (SoCs). In this article, we describe our work on hardware virtualization support in the RISC-V CVA6 core. Our contribution is multifold and encompasses architecture, microarchitecture, and design space exploration (DSE). In particular, we highlight the design of a set of microarchitectural enhancements [i.e., G-stage translation lookaside buffer (GTLB) and second-level TLB (L2 TLB)] to alleviate the virtualization performance overhead. We also perform a DSE and accompanying postlayout simulations (based on 22-nm FDX technology) to assess performance, power, and area (PPA). Furthermore, we map design variants on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform (Genesys 2) to assess the functional performance-area tradeoff. Based on the DSE, we select an optimal design point for the CVA6 with hardware virtualization support. For this optimal hardware configuration, we collected functional performance results by running the MiBench benchmark on Linux atop Bao hypervisor for a single-core configuration. We observed a performance speedup of up to 16% (approximately 12.5% on average) compared with virtualization-aware nonoptimized design at the minimal cost of 0.78% in area and 0.33% in power. Finally, all works described in this article are publicly available and open-sourced for the community to further evaluate additional design configurations and software stacks.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169681051"

Detecting and classifying sound sources is a primary task to control this noise. Currently, advanced sound event detection (SED) is achieved through the use of deep learning (DL) models. However, one downside of DL is the large amount of labeled data required to train the models effectively. Labeling large datasets is costly and time-consuming, and synthetically generated datasets created so far have yet to be able to provide the spatiotemporality of the sound sources within the soundscape. To address these problems, this paper introduces a synthetic polyphonic ambient sound source (SPASS), a novel synthetic polyphonic dataset that features spatiotemporal labels of sound sources. The new dataset, created with acoustic virtual reality tools, is used to pre-train a DL model for polyphonic SED in urban soundscapes. The SPASS dataset was created by simulating five different soundscapes to ensure that DL models are not tailored to any specific soundscape type. The DL model was evaluated using a transfer learn- ing methodology on two real-world SED tasks involving urban sound events. The DL model pre-trained with SPASS significantly outperformed that trained solely on actual data and achieved similar results as one pre-trained using Google Au- dioset, a dataset that is 100 times larger than SPASS. Additionally, pre-training with the new SPASS dataset proved to be better at effectively detecting and classifying traffic-related sound sources in urban soundscapes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173805250"

The investigation of the potential of positive emotions in securing beneficial effects on these aspects has long been a matter for exploration. The effectiveness of positive mood induction procedures has been considered among the various techniques used to promote well-being and health. Studies using various methodologies to elicit positive emotions were analyzed in this systematic review, to evaluate the effect of increasing positive affect on the well-being and health of healthy and clinical individuals. Two databases (Web of Science and Pubmed) were analyzed, and 32 articles were considered eligible based on the inclusion criteria. Positive mood induction procedures resulted effective in eliciting the predetermined emotions, as confirmed by subjective and in some cases even physiological measures. The results, except for two items, demonstrated beneficial effects in promoting well-being and health in both healthy subjects and, especially, clinical patients. In addition, techniques involving the use of Virtual Reality (VR) were found to be more effective. By allowing environments created under controlled laboratory conditions with high levels of presence and interactivity, virtual reality environments provide an immersive experience that amplifies both ecology and duration of induced emotions. Based on these findings, future research should focus on the possibility of integrating positive mood induction as an intervention strategy in clinical settings and for the promotion of general well-being. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169067166"

Digital fashion has the potential to decouple some crucial aspects of the fashion industry from their material requirements. Considering the growing interest around the metaverse, nonfungible tokens, the rapid evolution of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology, and the growing presence of major fashion brands in gaming, an understanding of the commercial feasibility of digital fashion is becoming increasingly necessary. In this article, we explore the commercial feasibility of digital fashion and expose a strategically significant alignment of digital substitutes with four emerging consumer expectations: excitement, utility, relatability, and circularity. Our research shows that these expectations are contingent upon consumers’ increasingly sufficiency-oriented mindset and the modes of consumption this mindset generates. In developing what we call a sufficiency model, this article provides companies with the heuristic tools necessary to gain future-looking and practical insights to help them navigate this dematerialization of consumption and to identify long-term market opportunities within this area. Specifically, we offer eight suggestions to help companies take their first steps into this emerging space. © 2023 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168385827"

Urology as a specialty bolsters a diverse range of procedures requiring a variety of technical skills ranging from open and robotic surgery to endoscopic procedures. While hands-on supervised training on patients still remains the foundation of residency training and education, it may not be sufficient to achieve proficiency for graduation even if case minimums are achieved. It has been well-established that simulation-based education (SBE) can supplement residency training and achieve the required proficiency benchmarks. Recent Findings: Low-fidelity modules, such as benchtop suture kits or laparoscopic boxes, can establish a strong basic skills foundation. Eventually, residents progress to high-fidelity models to refine application of technical skills and improve operative performance. Human cadavers and animal models remain the gold standard for procedural SBE. Recently, given the well-recognized financial and ethical costs associated with cadaveric and animal models, residency programs have shifted their investments toward virtual and more immersive simulations. Summary: Urology as a field has pushed the boundaries of SBE and has reached a level where unexplored modalities, e.g., 3D printing, augmented reality, and polymer casting, are widely utilized for surgical training as well as preparation for challenging cases at both the residents, attending and team training level. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171754270"

Currently, there is limited data on haptic feedback’s effect on skill development. Our objective is to compare expert laparoscopists’ skills characteristics using VR delivered laparoscopic tasks via haptic and nonhaptic laparoscopic surgical interfaces. Methods: Five expert laparoscopists performed seven skills tasks on two laparoscopic simulators, one with and one without haptic features. Tasks consisted of 2-handed instrument navigation, retraction and exposure, cutting, electrosurgery, and complicated object positioning. Laparoscopists alternated platforms at default difficulty settings. Metrics included time, economy of movement, completed task elements, and errors. Progressive change in performance for the final three iterations were determined by repeated measures ANOVA. Iteration quartile means were determined and compared using paired t-tests. Results: No change in performance was noted in the last three iterations for any metric. There were no significant differences between platforms on the final two quartiles for most metrics except avoidance of over-stretch error for retraction; and cutting task was significantly better with haptics on all iteration quartiles (p < 0.03). Economy of movement was significantly better with haptics for both hands for clip application (p < 0.01) and better for right hand on complex object positioning (p < 0.05). Accuracy was better with haptics for retraction and cutting (p < 0.05) and clip application (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Results showed higher performance in accuracy, efficient instrument motion, and avoidance of excessive traction force on selected tasks performed on VR simulator with haptic feedback compared to those performed without haptics feedback. Laparoscopic surgeons interpreted machine-generated haptic cues appropriately and resulted in better performance with VR task requirements. However, our results do not demonstrate an advantage in skills acquisition, which requires additional study.

By developing a pricing model for metaverse platforms that consider both social network effects and cross network effects, we analyze the mechanism of network effects on the bundling strategies of Real-to-Virtual platforms. These strategies, in turn, give rise to different business models for metaverse platforms. We find that network effects have a crucial impact on the bundling strategy and business model of Real-to-Virtual platforms. When the social network effects are weak, platforms choose between mixed bundling and independent sales to accommodate both real and virtual businesses, resulting in what we term Digital Twin Platforms. When the cross network effects are relatively weak, platforms may prefer mixed bundling to encompass both types of products, leading to what we term Digital Collaboration Platforms. However, when the two types of network effects are comparable, platforms will adopt a dynamic approach and switch between three strategies to maintain their market position according to the strength of the two network effects and competitive market environment, which is classified as Real-virtual Interconstruction Platforms. Thus, network effects and bundling constitute important aspects that distinguish different Real-to-Virtual platforms, playing a crucial role in platform performance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170432311"

Traditional stress management techniques can be challenging for patients. Virtual reality (VR) relaxation appears promising to reduce stress; however, research on VR for psychiatric wards is limited. This mixed-methods study investigated feasibility and acceptability of integrating a VR relaxation clinic within acute psychiatric services. The study evaluated a VR relaxation session for inpatients and outpatients with acute psychiatric conditions (N = 42) and therapists’ (N = 6) experience facilitating VR sessions for patients. Self-report assessments of psychological wellbeing were completed by patients pre- and post-VR. Patients and therapists provided qualitative feedback. The number of violent incidents and restrictive practices on the wards in the 12 weeks before VR implementation was compared to the first 12 weeks of VR. Post-VR, there were statistically significant increases in patients’ relaxation, happiness, and connectedness to nature, and decreases in stress, anxiety, and sadness. Qualitative findings indicate patients found sessions enjoyable, relaxing, and helpful. Therapists provided positive feedback but highlighted practical challenges. Violent incidents and restrictive practices halved during VR implementation. VR relaxation appears feasible and acceptable in acute services. Larger studies should evaluate potential impact on psychiatric wards. © 2023","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173252768"

These untargeted detections, cross-matched to NGC 4632 and NGC 6156, are some of the first galaxies where the H i observations show two distinct components. We used the iDaVIE virtual reality software to separate the anomalous gas from the galactic gas and found that the anomalous gas comprises ?50 per cent of the total H i content of both systems. We have generated plausible 3D kinematic models for each galaxy, assuming that the rings are circular and inclined at 90° to the galaxy bodies. These models show that the data are consistent with PRGs but do not definitively prove that the galaxies are PRGs. By projecting these models at different combinations of main disc inclinations, ring orientations, and angular resolutions in mock data cubes, we have further investigated the detectability of similar PRGs in WALLABY. Assuming that these galaxies are indeed PRGs, the detectability fraction, combined with the size distribution of WALLABY PDR1 galaxies, implies an incidence rate of ?1-3 per cent. If this rate holds true, the WALLABY survey will detect hundreds of new polar ring galaxies.  © 2023 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173247174"

Regardless of the numerous natural language interfaces already proposed for intuitive HRI on the industrial shop floor, most of those interfaces remain tightly bound with a specific robotic system. Besides, the lack of a natural and efficient human–robot communication protocol hinders the user experience. Therefore three key elements characterize the proposed framework. First, a Client–Server style architecture is introduced so Max can provide a centralized solution for managing and controlling various types of robots deployed on the shop floor. Second, inspired by human–human communication, two conversation strategies, lexical-semantic and general diversion strategies, are used to guide Max's response generation. These conversation strategies were embedded to improve the operator's engagement with the manufacturing tasks. Third, we fine-tuned the state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained model, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), to support a highly accurate prediction of requested intents from the operator and robot services. Multiple experiments were conducted using the latest iteration of our autonomous industrial mobile manipulator, “Little Helper (LH)”, to validate Max's performance in a real manufacturing environment. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168410918"

The indications of the Digicomp framework and 21st-century skills in Europe have outlined the key competences for lifelong learning needed for all citizens, including teachers and students. In this perspective, Education plays a fundamental role in ensuring that citizens acquire the required skills. The objective in the common European framework is clear: to initiate a transition from the culture of knowledge to the culture of competence. Nowadays, technological advancement allows the researchers to create and combine different frameworks with the perspective of an even more tailored, and engaged education, some examples derived from the implementation of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), in the combination of Gamification and AI, or the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to foster and create an even more personalized learning and teaching.

The analysis carried on, suggests a perspective on how creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving can be effective in promoting computational thinking, and how Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be an aid instrument to teachers in the fostering of creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving in schools and educational contexts. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172478955"

The study found a significant increase in the macro conversion probability and the loyalty level of website users due to user experience factors. It was revealed that the desire to secure oneself from COVID-19 is the main trigger of website traffic, and the effect of internal distraction due to content overload is the main barrier preventing electronic purchases.

Specifically, it evaluates the performance of different ways of using SR-IOV, including MacVTap “passthrough” mode with SR-IOV and PCI Passthrough on the Linux data plane. The study aims to shed light on how SR-IOV can be leveraged to optimize round-trip time (RTT) and resource usage. Through the experiments, we confirmed the expected behaviors of the technology but also clarified and identified behavioral aspects not yet known. For example, we confirmed that SR-IOV could improve RTT and outperform more traditional configurations, but we identified that this comes at the price of utilizing more computational resources, such as the CPU, depending on the orchestrated usage configuration. Furthermore, our evaluations also found that configuring the SR-IOV MacVTap in “passthrough” mode appears to be the best configuration when CPU resources are scarce or low or when scalability and flexibility are design requirements. In this article, we also expanded the SR-IOV assessment regarding the concurrency of this feature. Through these assessments, we identified that a VM without SR-IOV in a data center with other VMs that benefit from SR-IOV is inefficient from a performance point of view of communication. Thus, in this way, this study provides valuable information on how to optimize the use of SR-IOV in KVM environments to design efficient and high-performance virtualized data centers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171619662"

However, achieving low-cost and high-volume fabrication of strain-sensing e-textiles with both a wide strain working range and high sensitivity remains a huge challenge. Herein, we report high-performance printed strain-sensing e-textiles by designing the composite conductive ink from the perspective of optimizing polymer binders. The composite conductive inks based on different polymer binders present different rheological properties, volume shrinkage, and mechanical properties, which further affect the sensing performance of printed strain-sensing e-textiles. Compared with other four composite conductive inks, the carbon blacks/high elastic transparent glue-based printed strain-sensing e-textile with microcrack structure exhibits higher sensitivity (120.6 at a strain range of 0–100%) over a wide strain working range (150%), while also exhibiting low detection limits (0.1%) and outstanding dynamic stability (10000 cycles). On this basis, the demonstration of smart clothing integrated with 9 printed strain-sensing elements in human body posture recognition and monitoring proves its application prospects in human–machine interaction and virtual reality.

However, it is still a challenge to achieve wide working temperature and multi-parameter body motion sensing with TENG sensors. To address that, this work reports a facile 3D printing-based strategy for preparing functionalized heat-resistant TENG sensors. In detail, a printable heat-resistant ink and multiple 3D printing-based assembly methods are proposed. The as-fabricated ink, which could maintain up to 200 ℃, then serves as multiple components in the TENG sensors through patterning. Functionalized TENG sensors and human–machine interfaces are printed and subsequently networked on a human body to sense comprehensive motion information. The results indicate six typical motions can be recognized with 94.85% accuracy based on neural network algorithms. A simple digital twin for motion capture and trace tracking in virtual space is furthermore implemented.

In this research, the results of experiments on Thecla as a personalised comfort system (PCS) are investigated to evaluate the cooling effect of Thecla and its impact on thermal comfort. The experiments took place in a controlled-environment climate chamber using a thermal manikin. Furthermore, visualisation as a virtual reality technology was integrated in a digital shadow using the sensors' readings to enhance visualising the thermal impact of Thecla. Comparing the measurements at 28 °C and 30 °C; the higher the temperature, the better the effect of Thecla is on the body parts of the manikin. The results of Thecla as a cooling PCS in 30 °C presented a reduction of local skin temperature by up to 0.5 K. In addition, a reduction was observed in local thermal sensation of 0.12–0.38 points of the 9-point scale; as well as an increase in the body heat dissipation by about 10%. The digital shadow was built on the data of empirical measurements to resemble an interface to monitor thermal changes to improve users' perception of the thermal variations in the ambiance of Thecla. Thus, an easy-to-understand observation of the results allows further control of Thecla based on the visualisation and consequently enhances thermal comfort.

However, existing schemes only consider general and time-invariant QoE optimization, which may suffer performance degradation. Moreover, it is also necessary to ensure the fairness of the individual user's performance in wireless VR. To address these challenges, we employ digital twin technology to investigate a max-min QoE-optimal problem for wireless VR systems in this paper. Specifically, we maximize the QoE of the worst-case head-mounted displays (HDMs) client, where the QoE model is the linear weighting combination of video quality, service delay, and energy efficiency. The formulated optimization problem is characterized by multidimensional control, which jointly optimizes model selection, transmit power, computation time, and GPU-cycle frequency. Due to the mixed combinatorial features of the optimization problem, we give a low-complexity algorithm design by decoupling the optimization variables. Notably, we first obtain the allocation of the transmit power by employing the generalized fractional programming theory and the Lagrangian dual decomposition, followed by attaining the optimal allocation of GPU-cycle frequency in VR mode is derived by the proposed adaptive modified harmony search algorithm, and finally achieve the computation time by the barrier method. Meanwhile, we devise a greedy-style heuristic algorithm for mode selection. In the simulation, three baseline schemes are established as comparisons to assess the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Meanwhile, the simulation results manifest that the proposed algorithms have good convergence performance and better increase the QoE of the DT-enabled wireless VR system compared to benchmark solutions.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171530967"

Motivated by such hybrid systems, we propose queueing models with two types of service facilities: legacy servers and virtual machines. Key features to focus on are that while legacy servers are always on standby, virtual machines need setup time to be ready for service because they are shutdown to reduce the power consumption if no jobs are waiting.

Virtual reality (VR) based education may play an important role in this experience. Methods: In this prospective cohort educational study nurses (n = 83) participated in a VR experience on the assessment of pediatric respiratory distress and failure, followed by a survey assessing demographics, retrospective pre/post self-assessment of competence, immersion, and attitudes toward VR. Results: The VR curriculum significantly improved nurses’ self-assessed competence in the recognition and management of respiratory distress and failure. Participants endorsed that the VR experience mimicked real-life patient experiences, was more effective than traditional education modalities, accurately depicted, reinforced, and would influence future care of patients with respiratory distress and failure. Conclusions: Findings suggest the VR curriculum improved nurse perception of their ability to care for patients with respiratory distress and failure. VR may represent a new modality for training new nurses on the clinical assessment of respiratory distress and failure. © 2023 International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173500382"

However, the retrieval of 3D objects presents significant challenges due to the intricate nature of 3D models, which can vary in shape, size, and texture, and have numerous polygons and vertices. To this end, we introduce a novel SHREC challenge track that focuses on retrieving relevant 3D animal models from a dataset using sketch queries and expedites accessing 3D models through available sketches. Furthermore, a new dataset named ANIMAR was constructed in this study, comprising a collection of 711 unique 3D animal models and 140 corresponding sketch queries. Our contest requires participants to retrieve 3D models based on complex and detailed sketches. We receive satisfactory results from eight teams and 204 runs. Although further improvement is necessary, the proposed task has the potential to incentivize additional research in the domain of 3D object retrieval, potentially yielding benefits for a wide range of applications. We also provide insights into potential areas of future research, such as improving techniques for feature extraction and matching and creating more diverse datasets to evaluate retrieval performance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172471189"

In VEC, task offloading can enable vehicles to offload the computing tasks to nearby Roadside Units (RSUs) that deploy computing capabilities. However, the highly dynamic network topology, strict low-delay constraints, and massive data of tasks of VEC pose significant challenges for implementing efficient offloading. Digital Twin-based VEC is emerging as a promising solution that enables real-time monitoring of the state of the VEC network through mapping and interaction between the physical and virtual worlds, thus assisting in making sound offload decisions in the physical world. Thus, this paper proposes an intelligent partial offloading scheme, namely, Digital Twin-Assisted Intelligent Partial Offloading (IGNITE). First, to find the optimal offloading space in advance, we combine the improved clustering algorithm with the Digital Twin (DT) technique, in which unreasonable decisions can be avoided by reducing the size of the decision space. Second, to reduce the overall cost of the system, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is employed to train the offloading strategy, allowing for automatic optimization of computational delay and vehicle service price. To improve the efficiency of cooperation between digital and physical spaces, a feedback mechanism is established. It can adjust the parameters of the clustering algorithm based on the final offloading results in this clustering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on DT-assisted vehicle offloading that proposes a feedback mechanism, forming a complete closed loop as prediction-offloading-feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IGNITE has significant advantages in terms of total system computational cost, total computational delay, and offloading success rate compared with its counterparts.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169704489"

The use of conventional robot-Assisted surgery, where the surgeon is solely responsible for manipulation, is limited when it comes to complex surgical procedures that require real-Time manipulations such as mandibular angle split osteotomy and decompressive laminectomy. With the rising demands of manipulation, we proposed a shared control framework which automates surgical subtasks like milling-path following. These subtasks have demands on contact control, orientation control, and positional control. The robot provides hands-on hapic transparency and milling-path control with a virtual-fixture-based hybrid force/position methods simultaneously in real-Time. The hybrid task's decomposition method is derived from Frenet-Serret frames and can be adaptive to patients' movement. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated on a 7 DOF manipulator. Results of the lateral positions/force indicated that with the osteotomy shared control framework, lateral positional errors and transparent force errors can be constrained within 0.7mm and 1.35 N (2.52 N considering noises), which is superior to the average deviation of surgeons with free hand (up to 5.0 mm) and the extra payloads to hands due to weight (around 10.0 N).  © 2018 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173003631"

Machine learning (ML) models trained in DT for MN (DTMN) virtual environments can be more robustly implemented in MN. This can avoid the training difficulties and runtime errors caused by MN instability and multiple failures. However, when using data from various devices in the MN system, DTs must prioritize data privacy. Federated learning (FL) enables the construction of models without data leaving devices to protect DTMN data privacy. Nevertheless, FL's privacy protection needs further improvement for it only guarantees device-level data ownership but ignores that models may retain private information from data. Therefore, this paper focuses on data forgetting in privacy protection, and proposes a novel FL-based unlearning framework (FedME2), which contains MEval and MErase modules. Guided by memory evaluation information from MEval and employing MErase's multi-loss training approach, FedME2 gets accurate data forgetting in DTMN. In four DTMN virtual environments, FedME2 achieves an average data forgetting rate of approximately 75% for global models under FL and kept the influence on global models' accuracy below 4%. FedME2 has better data forgetting and improves DTMN data privacy protection while guaranteeing model accuracy.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169675156"

Based on research findings that hint at the importance of spaciousness for promoting a selfless (rather than self-centered) mode of psychological functioning, an experimental study was conducted using VR-simulations of natural landscapes varying in the extent of spaciousness and type of nature. Results show that spacious, rather than dense, landscapes promote selflessness and related measures including connectedness and positive affect.

Patient participation rates in prior attempts at direct radiology consultation vary widely in the literature. Our objective was to design and build a virtual radiology consult service for a subset of patients undergoing lung cancer screening CTs to enable communication between patients and radiologists regarding imaging results and radiology recommendations. Methods: Patients scheduled for lung cancer screening CTs were identified using a custom scheduling system and offered via text message a free 15-minute consultation with a radiologist to discuss the results. Results: Of 38 patients texted, 10 (26.3%) responded. Nine (90%) scheduled a consultation, but 5 (55.5%) subsequently cancelled. Of the remaining four, 3 (75%) attended their appointments, with an overall 3/38 (7.9%) text-to-consult conversation rate. The 3 consults averaged 18 (±8.2) minutes. Conclusion: The recruitment rate for our virtual service was between the low rate of a prior phone consult line study and the high rate in consults integrated into another physician visit. Further research is needed to identify patients most interested in a radiology consultation and optimize consultation modality by patient population. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171174194"

However, little is known about whether coastal environments influence physiological parameters of stress, whether these influences differ from those of urban and green environments, and whether these effects depend on the level of precedent stress. The current study exposed 164 participants (18-65y, 68% female) from the Flemish population to two 16-minute virtual reality exposures (i.e. beach vs. green or urban) via a randomized crossover design, during which the heart rate, high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), skin conductance responses (SCR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), breathing rate, and upper trapezius muscle tone were monitored. Self-reported measures of stress were also taken. General linear mixed models analyzed for each parameter whether the change over time differed per exposed environment and by the level of stress in the past week (from ‘low’ to ‘moderate’ levels), while controlling for study design and participant related covariates. Results show that beaches caused lower breathing rates than urban environments and lower SCR than green environments. The upper trapezius muscle tone showed complex patterns, and the heart rate, HF-HRV, and MAP did not react differently to the beach than to the urban and green environments. The individuals’ level of stress in the past week did not affect these differences much. Self-reported measures showed that, under moderate stress, beaches decreased the negative mood and perceived stress, whereas green environments did not and urban environments generally had more adverse effects on the negative mood, perceived stress, positive mood, and perceived quality for relaxation. This study demonstrates that beaches slow down breathing and reduce the sympathetic nervous system activity, and highlights the benefits of beaches for health and wellbeing. The results mark the importance of considering diverse physiological pathways of stress and the individuals’ precedent stress. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169028487"

However, the performance of phase recognition is limited by the use of information related to the presence of surgical instruments. To address the problem, we propose visual modality-based multimodal fusion for surgical phase recognition to overcome the limited diversity of information such as the presence of instruments. Using the proposed methods, we extracted a visual kinematics-based index related to using instruments, such as movement and their interrelations during surgery. In addition, we improved recognition performance using an effective convolutional neural network (CNN)-based fusion method for visual features and a visual kinematics-based index (VKI). The visual kinematics-based index improves the understanding of a surgical procedure since information is related to instrument interaction. Furthermore, these indices can be extracted in any environment, such as laparoscopic surgery, and help obtain complementary information for system kinematics log errors. The proposed methodology was applied to two multimodal datasets, a virtual reality (VR) simulator-based dataset (PETRAW) and a private distal gastrectomy surgery dataset, to verify that it can help improve recognition performance in clinical environments. We also explored the influence of a visual kinematics-based index to recognize each surgical workflow by the instrument's existence and the instrument's trajectory. Through the experimental results of a distal gastrectomy video dataset, we validated the effectiveness of our proposed fusion approach in surgical phase recognition. The relatively simple yet index-incorporated fusion we propose can yield significant performance improvements over only CNN-based training and exhibits effective training results compared to fusion based on Transformers, which require a large amount of pre-trained data. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173013953"

Focusing on the hospitality industry, the first study shows that smart speakers improve evaluations of the hotels that use them in terms of customer ratings and positive affects. The second study demonstrates that automated social presence and psychological ownership feelings are key mechanisms that explain the development of valuable customer responses. The third study, which uses virtual reality, suggests that better actual behaviors are exhibited by people who appreciate the incorporation of smart speakers into services.

Multiple VNFs usually chain up to formulate Service Function Chains (SFC) to enable complex network services. With the exploitation of VNF parallelism, SFC with parallel VNFs (Para-SFC) is proposed to reduce the SFC execution delay. However, the inner-structure of a Para-SFC is usually complex and a Para-SFC may have multiple legitimate topologies. DAG-SFC is one of the basic sharping methods for standardizing the topology of Para-SFCs. To adapt to the fast development of edge computing, it is critical to find an optimal deployment of Para-SFCs in hybrid edge-and-cloud network with the purpose of maximizing the amount of the flows completely serviced in the edge. In this paper, we first analyze the target problem via integer program modeling and prove its NP-hardness. Then, we propose a heuristic algorithm named NEST, which is based on the combination of maximum spanning tree and Next Fit. With extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that, compared with the benchmark methods, NEST can achieve up to respective 14% and 37% performance gain on DAG-SFC edge deployment maximization while can always realize (up to respective 276% and 305%) higher efficiency of link usage. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170099654"

However, the current video-based HAR methods still cannot fully extract abstract action features, and there is still a lack of action collection and recognition for special personnel such as prisoners and elderly people living alone. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a multidimensional feature fusion network, called P-MTSC3D, a parallel network based on context modeling and temporal adaptive attention module. It consists of three branches. The first branch serves as the basic network branch, which extracts basic feature information. The second branch consists of a feature pre-extraction layer and two multiscale-convolution-based global context modeling combined squeeze and excitation (MGSE) modules, which can extract spatial and channel features. The third branch consists of two temporal adaptive attention units based on convolution (TAAC) to extract temporal dimension features. In order to verify the validity of the proposed network, this paper conducts experiments on the University of Central Florida (UCF) 101 dataset and the human motion database (HMDB) 51 dataset. The recognition accuracy of the proposed P-MTSC3D network is 97.92% on the UCF101 dataset and 75.59% on the HMDB51 dataset, respectively. The FLOPs of the P-MTSC3D network is 30.85G, and the test time is 2.83 s/16 samples on the UCF101 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the P-MTSC3D network has better overall performance than the state-of-the-art networks.

By pushing computing and storage resources from the cloud to the network edge, it reduces transmission latency, and supports applications that require low latency, such as virtual reality and video analytics IoT services. However, many existing works only consider the problem of service placement in MEC, and the problem of computing resource allocation has received less attention. This paper focuses on the joint optimization of Service Placement and computational Resource Allocation (SPRA) in the MEC environment, with the goal of minimizing the total cost of service latency, communication latency, and service migration. For offline cases, we propose an optimal algorithm, D-SPA, based on dynamic programming and an improved algorithm, S-SPA, based on state sampling, which effectively alleviates the state explosion problem in D-SPA. In the online case, due to the unpredictability of future environmental information, we propose the online greedy algorithm OGA, and theoretically show the approximate ratio of OGA.

It has broad prospects in many applications, such as Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality, smart homes and intelligent medical systems. Therefore, it has become a research hotspot in recent years. This paper investigates a lightweight micro-motion gesture recognition method based on Multiple Input and Multiple Output millimeter wave radar. We employ TI’s MMWCAS radar, comprising four cascaded AWR1243 radar boards, to collect gesture data. During the data pre-processing stage, we extract the Range-time Map, Doppler-time Map, Azimuth-time Map and Elevation-time Map of the dynamic gestures to characterize the dynamic motion features. These maps are then simplified into a one-dimensional vector to reduce data volume. We propose an 8HBi-GRU model, which combines the Bidirectional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) with a multi-head self-attention mechanism, to identify twelve types of micro-motion gestures using feature vectors. The model achieves an accuracy of 98.24 % , with precision and recall rates exceeding 0.97 and 0.98, respectively, for ten of the gesture types. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 8HBi-GRU model achieves lightweight gesture recognition rapidly and requires minimal storage space compared to image-based deep learning methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170038249"

However, dynamic scene changes, attack feature reliance, high data dimensions, and challenges with spatio-temporal feature fusion frequently pose limitations to attack traffic identification in IoT contexts. Definitive intelligent IoT attack identification enables intelligent algorithms to extract attack features for application scenarios with fixed topological environments but cannot construct the intricate changes of IoT application scenarios. Through the dynamic acquisition, feature awareness, and deep learning, intelligent digital twin-based attack detection can address these issues and enhance attack identification for IoT threats. Thus, this paper proposed an intelligent digital twin method based on spatio-temporal feature fusion for IoT attack behavior identification. Firstly, feature subsets are selected based on information gain to reduce the dimensionality of IoT data with high traffic; Secondly, a parallel spatio-temporal feature extraction model is designed unlike the existing tandem model, which uses a simplified Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model to learn the spatial features of the attack, a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model to learn the temporal features of the attack, an attention mechanism to fuse the temporal and spatial features, and the (Deep Neural Networks) DNN to learn the combined features; Finally, the virtual instance space and topology of the attack scenario are simulated using digital twin (DT) to build a digital version of the complex system for IoT applications and tested in a simulation environment. Based on experimental results using the UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017 datasets, this paper shows that the proposed method can extract spatio-temporal features from network attack traffic and has a 5% improvement in test accuracy.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169702511"

Its implementation can provide users with personalized services or improved human-computer interaction, such as smart home control, in-car interaction, etc., most of existing gesture recognition methods are based on vision or wearable device. However, the vision-based methods face the problem of privacy breach, whereas the wearable-based methods may bring inconvenience to users. With the wide deployment of Wi-Fi networks, lots of consumer devices are widely accessible in people's homes. Motivated by the fact that Wi-Fi signal propagation can be affected by human motion, the opportunity to use Wi-Fi signals for gesture recognition can be further explored. However, the challenge is that the received Wi-Fi signal shows great differences when the same person performs the same gesture in different environments or different person performs the same gesture in the same environment. Therefore, the signal alignment across different domain needs to be solved. In this paper, we propose a gesture recognition system named Phase-Attention-based-Conv-CSI (PAC-CSI), which consists of two modules: data processing and gesture recognition. In the data processing module, we eliminate random phase noise in channel state information (CSI) and perform phase calibration. In the gesture recognition module, we feed the processed phase sequence into a lightweight deep neural network for gesture recognition. PAC-CSI can obtain the gesture category in about 200ms, which can meets the real-time requirements of DT. The gesture recognition accuracy of our proposed system in a single domain is 99.46%, and its performance across new locations, orientations, users, and environments is 98.77%, 98.90%, 97.54%, and 96.47%, respectively.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169703570"

Through a between-subject study design, recruited participants were asked to perform construction tasks in a virtual reality environment, with or without the presence of drones, to measure these impacts. Results obtained from the objective and subjective measures showed that drone presence was not associated with changes in participants' physiological and emotional states.

It also has applications in creating image datasets for training learning-based vision models. As camera image simulation takes into account a wide variety of external and internal parameters, achieving a high-fidelity simulation is a computationally expensive process. Recently, several neural network-based techniques have been proposed to reduce the computational complexity of image rendering, a critical element of the camera simulation pipeline. However, the existing methods are tailored for monocular camera images and are not optimised for stereo images, which are widely used in autonomous driving applications. To address this, we propose a technique based on Stereo Super Resolution (SSR) to speed up the simulation of stereo images. The proposed method first simulates stereo images at a lower resolution, then super-resolves them to their original resolution using our introduced SSR model, ETSSR. We evaluated the performance of our technique using the CARLA driving simulator and created our own synthetic dataset for training ETSSR. The evaluations indicate that our approach can speed up stereo image simulation by a factor of up to 2.57 over various resolutions. Moreover, it shows that our ETSSR achieves on-par or superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art models, using significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs.

Design: A prospective randomised controlled trial. Setting: A London University Teaching Hospital. Population: Women aged 18–70 years undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy procedures. Methods: An unblinded randomised controlled trial was performed between March and October 2022 comparing standard outpatient hysteroscopy care with standard care with the addition of a virtual reality headset playing a virtual reality immersive scenario as a distraction technique. Main outcome measures: Pain and anxiety numeric rating scores (NRS) from 0 to 11. Results: Eighty-three participants were randomly allocated to the control (n = 42) and virtual reality groups (n = 41). The virtual reality group experienced significantly less anxiety during the procedure than the control group (mean NRS 3.29 versus 4.73, mean difference 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12–2.88; P = 0.03). There was no difference in reported average pain (mean NRS 3.73. versus 4.24, mean difference 0.51; 95% CI −1.76 to 0.64; p = 0.41) or maximum pain scores (mean NRS 5.32 versus 5.07, mean difference 0.25; 95% CI −1.05 to 1.55; P = 0.71). Conclusions: The use of virtual reality technology as an adjunct to standard care can reduce patient-reported anxiety but not pain during outpatient hysteroscopy procedures. Continued improvements in the technology and the development of increasingly immersive environments may continue to increase the potential to improve the patient experience in this setting. © 2023 The Authors.

MIT's Resource Exploration and Science of our Cosmic Environment (RESOURCE) team participated in the course in the fall of 2021 with a Zero-G flight in May of 2022 testing technology for a virtual reality platform to enable science on Lunar rover exploration missions. In parallel with the scientific effort, the team developed the MIT Zero-G Outreach Initiative (0G-OI), an outreach program to engage with the Cambridge Public School's (CPS) grade 7 classes to teach them about research in microgravity, parabolic flight, and experiment design. The goal of the outreach program is to inspire the next generation of space scientists and engineers using virtual reality. The CPS grade 7 curriculum covers ‘Mysteries of the Universe’ where students consider the role of gravity in the solar system. They also complete a unit on roller coasters in which they learn about key ideas of force, motion, and energy through the context of roller coasters. The 0G-OI Initiative ties these two units together through five videos covering: 1) an overview of the initiative, 2) the basics of parabolic flight and how we perceive gravity, 3) an overview of gravity and its function in the universe, 4) why and what we can study in microgravity and 5) how to design an experiment for microgravity. The students then design their own experiments for microgravity. These are down-selected to the top 5 experiments that are reviewed by an astronaut to select one experiment to fly on the MIT chartered Zero-G parabolic flight. The flight and the experiment are filmed in VR video by the MIT RESOURCE team. Each participating school is provided with an Oculus Quest 2 VR headset and a flight day is held at each school where the students experience the Zero-G flight and see the results of their experiment in an immersive VR environment. Using this initial setup, the 0G-OI can be run annually in parallel with MIT's SEI parabolic flight course. Some key development parameters included keeping the educational videos under 10 min, that having an astronaut select the winning experiment provided incentive and finally, using VR, as this technology is commonly associated with gaming and entertainment. Lessons learned focused on improvements to scheduling and coordination with Zero-G, in-person programming and classroom experience optimization.

However, implementation of digital interventions in rehabilitation is poorly understood. This scoping review aims to map current strategies, research designs, frameworks, outcomes and determinants used to support and evaluate the implementation of digital interventions in rehabilitation. Data sources: Comprehensive searches from inception until October 2022 of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PEDro, SpeechBITE, NeuroBITE, REHABDATA, WHO International Clinical Trial Registry and the Cochrane Library. Methods: Two reviewers screened studies against the eligibility criteria. Implementation science taxonomies and methods, including Powell et al.'s compilation of implementation strategies, were used to guide analysis and synthesis of findings. Results: The search retrieved 13,833 papers and 23 studies were included. Only 4 studies were randomised controlled trials and 9 studies (39%) were feasibility studies. Thirty-seven discrete implementation strategies were reported across studies. Strategies related to training and educating clinicians (91%), providing interactive assistance (61%), and developing stakeholder interrelationships (43%) were most frequently reported. Few studies adequately described implementation strategies and methods for selecting strategies. Almost all studies measured implementation outcomes and determinants; most commonly, acceptability, compatibility and dose delivered of digital interventions. Conclusion: The rigour of implementation methods in the field is currently poor. Digital interventions require carefully planned and tailored implementation to facilitate successful adoption into rehabilitation practice. To keep pace with rapidly advancing technology, future rehabilitation research should prioritise using implementation science methods to explore and evaluate implementation while testing effectiveness of digital interventions. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158915807"

In this paper, we designed a VR “trust game” scene to evaluate the effects of four expression conditions (positive facial expressions, neutral facial expressions, negative facial expressions and no expressions and lip-syncing) on participants in an immersive VR scene. We measured the participants with both objective and subjective measures. The two objective behavioral measures were the level of investment in the “trust game” and the users’ eye-movement data, and the subjective measures included social presence, emotional awareness level, and user preferences. We found that the participants were generally less trusting of the avatars with negative expressions, while the avatars with positive expressions made the participants feel comfortable and thus increased their willingness to cooperate with the avatars. In conclusion, avatars with facial expressions, whether positive or negative, were more effective in influencing the participants’ trust levels and decision-making behaviors than those without facial expressions.

When discourse is assessed in people with communication disability, structured tasks (e.g., picture descriptions) provide experimental control, while unstructured tasks (e.g., personal narratives) represent more natural communication. Immersive virtual reality (VR) technology may provide a solution by creating standardized experiences for narrative retell, therefore balancing ecological validity and experimental control in discourse assessment. Research is needed to understand how VR immersion affects narrative retell, first for adults with no communication disability, before application with adults with aphasia or related communication disability. Aims: To assess (1) the effects of VR immersion on the linguistic content and structure of narrative retells in a healthy adult population; and (2) whether VR immersion can influence the way a narrative is retold so that the speaker conveys their own experience, rather than the experience of the characters they are watching. Methods & Procedures: In this pilot cohort study, 13 healthy adult participants with no reported communication disability watched an animated short film and a comparable immersive VR short film in a randomized order. Participants were asked to retell the events of the story after each condition in as much detail as possible. Outcomes & Results: Mean length of utterance (in morphemes) was significantly higher in the video condition compared with the VR condition. Significantly more first-person pronouns were used in the VR condition compared with the video condition. No other measures of linguistic content or structure were significantly different between the VR and video conditions. Conclusions & Implications: Increased morpho-syntactic length and complexity in the video condition may suggest effects of elicitation stimulus on the narrative produced. The larger number of first-person pronouns in the VR condition may reflect that participants experienced a sense of presence in the virtual environment, and therefore were able to retell their communication experience rather than narrating the experiences of characters from an external perspective. Given the increasing need for more functional assessment of discourse in people with communication disability, further research is needed to validate these findings. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on this subject As an ecologically valid tool, discourse analysis is often used to assess daily communicative exchanges in adults with acquired communication disability. Clinicians and researchers using narrative discourse assessment must balance the experimental control and diagnostic reference sample capabilities of structured tasks with the ecological validity and real-life transferability of unstructured personal narratives. What this study adds to existing knowledge This study explores the use of immersive VR technologies to create standardized, replicable, immersive experiences as a foundation for narrative discourse assessment. It highlights how the ‘sense of presence’ in a virtual world can prompt healthy adult speakers to retell a narrative of a personal experience that can be replicated for many different participants. The results suggest that immersive VR narrative assessment for adults with communication disability may balance ecological validity with measurement reliability in discourse assessment. What are the potential or actual clinical observations of this work? Immersion in VR resulted in the production of narratives with morpho-syntactic features that aligned with typical narrative generation, rather than retell. Participants used more first-person pronouns, suggesting retelling of personal experience. Though further study is needed, these preliminary findings suggest clinicians can use immersive VR stimuli to generate structured story generations that balance experimental and diagnostic control with ecological validity in narrative discourse assessment for adults with communication disability. © 2023 The Authors.

A simulator must undergo rigorous validation to verify it as a reliable tool. The aim of this study was to review the literature to identify simulators that are currently available to augment thoracic surgical training and to analyze any evidence supporting or validating them. Methods: A literature search of the MEDLINE (1946 to November 2022) and Embase (1947 to November 2022) databases was performed to identify simulators for basic skills and procedures in thoracic surgery. A selection of keywords were used to perform the literature search. After identification of appropriate articles, data were extracted and analyzed. Results: Thirty-three simulators were found in 31 articles. Simulators for basic skills (n = 13) and thoracic lobectomy (n = 13) were most commonly described, followed by miscellaneous (n = 7). Most models were of a hybrid modality (n = 18). Evidence of validity was established in 48.5% (n = 16) of simulators. In total, 15.2% (n = 5) of simulators had 3 or more elements of validity demonstrated, and only 3.0% (n = 1) accomplished full validation. Conclusions: Numerous simulators of varying modality and fidelity exist for a variety of thoracic surgical skills and procedures, although validation evidence is frequently inadequate. Simulation models may be able to provide training in basic surgical and procedural skills; however, further assessment of validity needs to be undertaken before consideration of their integration into training programs. © 2023 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163277119"

Due to the potential risk to human health and the environment, all radioactive material is subject to strict control regarding its use and subsequent disposal. For this reason, all waste must be collected, treated and stored properly in specific facilities for this purpose. Therefore, methods and techniques that keep these wastes under control are of great importance for an efficient management of these wastes. Planning and constant training on waste management procedures help control these materials. One of the possible ways to carry out this planning and previous training of the activities is using computational simulators, these simulators allow a preview of the activities and a good estimate of the radiation that would be received, by the operators, in the real activity. In this context, the present work presents a methodology for a simulation system of dynamic reallocation of nuclear waste and the visualization of the generated radioactive mesh, in real time. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165538852"

Virtual network function (VNF) is a software program that replaces the hardware-based network functionality. The replacement of the hardware-based network functions (middleboxes) with software programs promises the on-demand provisioning of network functions and reduces capital and operational expenses of the network. Due to this replaced network can adapt to the different network functions. Network service providers deploy various network services with different objectives, such as reducing the network's active servers and traffic latency or network operational expenses. In this article, a VNF placement problem is studied to optimize the total operating costs of the networks. To solve the VNF placement problem, we proposed an integer linear program (ILP) model, which has been implemented using CPLEX. Although an ILP-based approach gives an optimal solution, it takes a long execution time to find the solution. Due to the long execution time, the ILP-based approach is not suitable for the real-time VNF placement problem. To address this challenge, we proposed a heuristic based on dynamic programming that performs better than the existing approaches. The simulation results of the proposed solution using real-world topologies show that the heuristic approach finds a feasible solution that is only 1 to 1.34 times far from the optimal one. Moreover, experimental results show that the proposed heuristic is 15 to 423 times faster than the ILP. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158036257"

Methods: This randomized controlled trial was conducted between October and December 2021. Final-year medical students were randomized into a 2-week short exposure group and a 4-week long exposure group on a 1:1 allocation. They were assessed using a virtual case with structured scoring system before and after the virtual patient simulation learning program. An end-of-program questionnaire on learners’ perceptions was also administered. Results: A total of 138 students were recruited. After the virtual patient simulation program, the virtual case score increment in the long exposure group was significantly higher than in the short exposure group with a mean score difference of 18/100 (95% confidence interval = 9.8 to 26.3). Questionnaire showed generally positive perceptions toward the use of virtual patient simulation program for emergency medicine teaching. Conclusion: Virtual reality learning of 2 and 4 weeks’ duration may be beneficial for improving emergency medicine clinical competence for final-year medical students, especially during periods of limited clinical exposure like the COVID-19 pandemic.

The emergence of wireless communication networks and new interactive devices have a significant influence on multimodal human–computer interaction, which has become a prominent area of research. In this paper, we analyze the psychological obstacles in sports by leveraging mobile intelligent information systems (MIIS) within the wireless communication networks. The paper begins by introducing the reasons and background of sports psychological barriers, then examines and summarizes existing academic research on sports psychological barriers and mobile intelligent information systems. Subsequently, the paper presents a comprehensive summary in conjunction with computer vision’ multimodal learning for human–computer interaction. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed, and various algorithms are analyzed for sports’ psychological barriers within the framework of mobile intelligent information systems. The paper also includes a factor analysis of sports psychological obstacles within the mobile intelligent information system. Finally, various experiments are conducted and the results are summarized and discussed. The experimental findings indicate a 4% improvement in the effectiveness of using mobile intelligent information systems for addressing sports psychological disorders compared to traditional methods.

A working group of 14 volunteers, comprising an international team of researchers from academia and industry, convened in 2021 to discuss how to improve the translational relevance and interpretation of findings from animal models that are used in preclinical psychopharmacology. The following paper distils the outcomes of the working group’s discussions into 10 key considerations for the planning and reporting of behavioural studies in animal models relevant to psychiatric disorders. These form the iTRIPP guidelines (Improving Translational Relevance In Preclinical Psychopharmacology). These guidelines reflect the key considerations that the group thinks will likely have substantial impact in terms of improving the translational relevance of behavioural studies in animal models that are used to study psychiatric disorders and their treatment. They are relevant to the research community when drafting and reviewing manuscripts, presentations and grant applications. The iTRIPP guidelines are intended to complement general recommendations for planning and reporting animal studies that have been published elsewhere, by enabling researchers to fully consider the most appropriate animal model for the research purpose and to interpret their findings appropriately. This in turn will increase the clinical benefit of such research and is therefore important not only for the scientific community but also for patients and the lay public. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166629984"

Robot positioning is a crucial step in the surgical setup that ensures proper reachability to the desired port locations and facilitates docking procedures. This very demanding task requires much experience to master, especially with multiple trocars, increasing the barrier of entry for surgeons in training. Methods: Previously, we demonstrated an Augmented Reality-based system to visualize the rotational workspace of the robotic system and proved it helps the surgical staff to optimize patient positioning for single-port interventions. In this work, we implemented a new algorithm to allow for an automatic, real-time robotic arm positioning for multiple ports. Results: Our system, based on the rotational workspace data of the robotic arm and the set of trocar locations, can calculate the optimal position of the robotic arm in milliseconds for the positional and in seconds for the rotational workspace in virtual and augmented reality setups. Conclusions: Following the previous work, we extended our system to support multiple ports to cover a broader range of surgical procedures and introduced the automatic positioning component. Our solution can decrease the surgical setup time and eliminate the need to repositioning the robot mid-procedure and is suitable both for the preoperative planning step using VR and in the operating room—running on an AR headset. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161366950"

Its positive impact on human wellbeing and health have been reported even after a single short exposure to awe-inspiring stimuli. Recently, Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a suitable technique for eliciting brief moments of intense awe. Moreover, nowadays, the Metaverse has increased the opportunity to access even complex experiences, such as awe, for a prolonged period. However, the impact of a prolonged exposure to an awe-inspiring simulated experience still must be investigated. Here, in the first study, we designed and tested usability, user experience and preliminary effectiveness of the first VR awe-inspiring training vs. an equivalent neutral training in VR. We relied on an immersive virtual reality online social platform- Altspace VR - for designing the training. In the second study, we investigated whether a prolonged exposure to awe could hold the same effect on creative thinking as it was demonstrated for brief exposure to awe in VR. Specifically, we tested the impact of a long-lasting exposure to awe on creative thinking in the short and on the long run (after the training and in a one-week follow-up) and vs. an equivalent neutral condition (the same as the first study). Creativity thinking, was assessed through Alternative Uses Task (AUT). Additionally, measures related to the disposition to feel positive emotions, social desirability and level of curiosity were collected. The first study supported the feasibility of the training together with the usability of the platform as well as its effectiveness in eliciting awe (vs. neutral condition). Moreover, for the second study, there was a main effect of time on some of the dimensions of creative thinking. Participants scored higher in fluency, originality, and flexibility one week after the training compared to the pre-training phase. These results suggested preliminary design guidelines for creating awe experiences in the Metaverse, unveiling the role of time exposure and duration of their effects on individuals. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165538489"

Model-driven engineering (MDE) methods have been proven to be effective in increasing the productivity of CPS design. However, there is still a lack of MDE approaches that enable design space exploration as well as the code generation for the design of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)-based CPSs. To mitigate the situation, this article presents a unified modeling language named AIoTML for AIoT-based CPSs, which enables the construction of AI-based components across different modeling levels for the purposes of intelligent sensing and control. By extending the constructs of state-of-the-art domain-specific language (DSL) ThingML, AIoTML can seamlessly unify the modeling of both autonomous executions of AIoT devices and their surrounding physical environment, which facilitates both platform-independent simulation and control optimization for platform-specific CPSs. The compiler developed for AIoTML provides a family of code generators to support the construction of digital twins on various heterogeneous target AIoT platforms. Comprehensive evaluations on two complex real-world designs demonstrate the effectiveness of our AIoTML approach in the fast development of AIoT-based CPSs with high control quality. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153337913"

Virtual reality (VR) has been identified to provide a method of constructive learning with instant feedback. There are increasing publications of VR use in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training; however, there is a dearth from the dental profession. Therefore, the aim of this exploratory study was to investigate dental students' opinions in CPR training using VR. Methods In total, 120 dental students undertook both conventional (manikin) and VR CPR training in a cross-over design. The VR scenario was in a hospital setting. Following, students completed a questionnaire evaluating their experiences. Results The majority of students (n = 88) reported that this was the first time that they had utilised VR. The experience of using VR in CPR training was rated as very good. Most students felt that the inclusion of VR in CPR training created a better learning experience and had a high learning potential. However, the hospital setting was not entirely relevant. Conclusion Dental students recommended that VR CPR training should be used as an adjunct to conventional training in dental education, but the VR scenario would benefit being a virtual dental environment. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175092334"

In the implementation process, VR could improve learning by increasing positive affective and cognitive processing, whereas VR also could hurt learning by increasing distraction and leading to poorer learning outcomes. Thus, understanding the cognitive processes that occur during the learning process using VR can provide sufficient information to unlock the learning potential. This research aims to determine cognitive processes through brain waves when participants perform VR learning and reading activity. Cognitive processing during VR learning was compared to the reading process because reading was a fundamental activity of the learning process and one of the most common ways of accessing knowledge. Brain Wave data on attention and meditation were collected using the Mindset EEG headset developed by Neurosky Inc., in which participants read the material and experienced VR simulation regarding the weightlessness concept. The results show that reading activity has a higher attention level than VR learning due to the many learning modalities in VR learning causing cognitive overload. Regarding the level of meditation, the brain activities indicate that the reading activity and VR learning activities have the same level of meditation. One of the most plausible explanations is the absence of cybersickness in VR learning. Moreover, according to the trend analysis of the brain wave activity, VR learning can possibly enhance the learning process in specific scenarios, such as when participants complete their mission in the VR simulation and start free exploration and when participants see something that they thought was extraordinarily embodied in VR. Besides that, VR learning can also distort the learning process, such as when participants are confused during instruction about which path to take and what the next step is, then cause distraction in learning. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153058948"

At the same time, VR platforms for research and education purposes in the field of daylight, such as one being built at TU Berlin, have to consider technical limitations. Besides the imperfections caused by simulation tools, VR head mounted displays (VR HMDs) bring additional shortcomings, one of the most obvious being the low maximum luminance compared to daylight. However, considering a typical viewing distance within VR HMDs is about 15 mm, and a usage duration can last up to 8 hours or more, concerns have arisen about the safety of displays with high luminance levels, particularly as a prototype claiming a maximum luminance of up to 6 000 cd/m2 has been introduced in the last years. Therefore, this paper compares the blue light hazard (BLH)-weighted radiances of VR HMDs to given exposure limits provided by the ICNIRP guidelines on limits of exposure to incoherent visible and infrared radiation and by the IEC 62471 (photobiological safety of lamps and lamp systems).

Here, we describe an approach for rapid production of three dimensional (3D)-printed mapping devices derived from magnetic resonance imaging. The mapping devices are equipped with flexible electronic arrays that are shaped to match the epicardial contours of the atria and ventricle and allow for epicardial electrical mapping procedures. We validate that these flexible arrays provide high-resolution mapping of epicardial signals in vivo using porcine models of AF and myocardial infarction. Specifically, global coverage of the epicardial surface allows for mapping and ablation of myocardial substrate and the capture of premature ventricular complexes with precise spatial–temporal resolution. We further show, as proof-of-concept, the localization of sites of VT by means of beat-to-beat whole-chamber ventricular mapping of ex vivo Langendorff-perfused human hearts. © 2023 The Authors.

Therefore, teachers are part of shaping tomorrow's citizens and leaders, and the teacher's central role can hardly be exaggerated. At the same time, the development of society challenges traditional educational assumptions and puts traditional practices under pressure. Due to technological and pedagogical advancements, artificial intelligence, as well as virtual reality, has gained momentum in research and education.

Conventional treadmills used for fitness can be repurposed for users to move around in virtual reality, but permit walking in only one direction (uni-directional). Treadmills that allow walking in any direction (omni-directional) are available, in which users walk-in-place and their feet slip on a low-friction surface. Given that users can experience cybersickness and postural instability in virtual reality, this study explored user performance and side effects of using two different walking platforms: a conventional uni-directional treadmill and a slip-style omni-directional treadmill (Virtuix OMNI). All participants (n = 46) played a game in which they collected items distributed around a virtual world. Participants moved around the virtual world by walking on the conventional uni-directional treadmill (for 10 minutes) and on the omni-directional treadmill (for 10 minutes), whilst in HMD-VR, with a 5-minute break between platforms. Measurements of cybersickness, task achievement, distance covered, posture, postural sway and user experience (ease, enjoyment, and effort) were collected. Participants experienced significantly higher total cybersickness after walking on the slip-style omni-directional treadmill compared to after walking on the uni-directional treadmill (p=.003), and significantly higher Nausea and Oculomotor cybersickness after walking on the slip-style omni-directional treadmill compared to after walking on the uni-directional treadmill (p<.001 and p=.005 respectively). Participants had lowest postural sway after using the uni-directional treadmill compared to after using the omni-directional treadmill (p=.052). Participants completed significantly more of the task (p<.001) and walked further (p<.001) on the uni-directional treadmill compared to the omni-directional treadmill, and their posture angle (back tilt angle) was significantly more forward on the omni-directional treadmill compared to the uni-directional treadmill (p<.001). Significant differences were found with participants reporting walking on the omni-directional treadmill to be more difficult (p<.001), require more effort (p<.001) and be less enjoyable (p=.005), and changing direction to require more effort (p=.010), than compared to the uni-directional treadmill. This study recommends that alternatives to slip-style locomotion treadmills be developed due the non-natural walking action required to use slip-style platforms and the consequent negative psychophysiological impacts of their use with HMD-VR. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166653924"

However, scientific findings have called into question the effectiveness of warnings to prevent accidents, albeit mostly based on consumers' self-reports. This study aimed to contribute to existing data on household chemicals and consumer safety by applying a novel observational method using virtual reality (VR). The study participants (N = 119) were observed after receiving a task to childproof a virtual apartment from various interactable neutral and hazardous objects (i.e. knives, lighters and household chemicals with and without warnings) that were placed in the virtual apartment. For the analysis, the object placement (i.e. accessible or inaccessible to the children) and the level of interaction with the objects were coded, and the observational data were supplemented with data gathered through a questionnaire. The results showed that most hazardous household chemicals were moved to spots that were inaccessible to the children without any interactions of the participants with the warnings. Instead, they used their pre-existing knowledge and intuitive strategies to judge the objects’ risks. These potentially misleading intuitive strategies should be increasingly considered in the regulation of hazardous household chemicals. This study also discussed the use and limitations of VR for the observation of human behaviour and decision making under uncertainty. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165417207"

Increasing burnup will afford economic viability by enabling utilities to optimize core designs to reduce the number of fresh fuel assemblies per cycle and allow nuclear power plants to operate for a longer period of time. Longer operating periods will also decrease the number of outages experienced by a nuclear power plants and, therefore, offer utilities significant operational savings. However, extending the peak rod-averaged burnup beyond 62 GWd/tU results in operating fuel rods to higher burnup under higher power conditions. This operating regime is expected to result in higher fuel temperatures, fission gas release (FGR), and rod internal pressures (RIPs) that may challenge historical safety basis and affect high-burnup (HBU) experimental testing. In particular, these conditions directly affect fuel fragmentation, relocation, and dispersal (FFRD) susceptibility, so understanding the pretransient operating conditions is critical for developing test plans that evaluate the FFRD and develop strategies to mitigate it. This paper evaluates the operating conditions and fuel performance of HBU (greater than62 GWd/tU rod average) fuel. Additionally, it investigates fuel performance sensitivities and discusses the effect on fuel performance. This work used two codes. Virtual Environment for Reactor Applications (VERA) was used to calculate steady-state power histories, identify HBU operating conditions using 10 different realistic HBU core designs, and down-select rods to a representative subset of fuel rods for subsequent BISON evaluation. The BISON fuel performance code was used to investigate steady-state HBU operating conditions and assess uncertainties associated with FGR and its effect on fuel temperatures and RIPs. The VERA and BISON results will provide direct input for HBU experimental testing and support subsequent TRACE and BISON transient fuel performance analyses. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164298045"

Towards this direction, the use of model-based digital twins able to simulate key aspects of the building is important. Despite the utilization of various digital twin approaches for smart buildings in recent years, most of these approaches mainly focus on one aspect of the building, such as indoor environmental quality or energy consumption. This observation necessitates the development of a virtual but realistic and non-invasive environment able to simulate all the key domains of the building, including indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and energy consumption. Towards this direction, this work proposes an architecture for smart buildings investigations, that emulates the thermal comfort, air-quality, and electricity consumption of the building, while considering the activities and behavior of occupants. For simulating the building operations, ordinary differential equations and power balance modeling are incorporated to facilitate real-time or faster than real-time digital twin approaches, while computational fluid dynamics modeling is used complementarily, to enable higher granularity simulations for offline analysis. Both models have been validated in a real building achieving less than 1% average zone temperature error between the simulation models and the actual building sensor measurements. Furthermore, a user-friendly software platform has been developed and integrated with the proposed architecture, where multiple important features and characteristics have been included to enable various investigations. In particular, the developed platform enables physical and simulated building integration, model calibration using field measurements, experimental configuration and management, execution of novel what-if investigations, and evaluation of novel algorithms using hardware-in-the-loop configurations. The proposed architecture is applied in a physical building, allowing the demonstration of several investigations and the execution of interesting use-cases. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166286967"

The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of three interactive virtual environments (i.e., social, relaxing, stressful) on enjoyment and persistence during strength-based exercises. In a within-subjects experiment, 97 healthy young adults completed four consecutive sets of two strength-based exercises. Participants completed one set as baseline and then each participant completed three more sets in three different interactive environments, experienced through a VR headset. Results showed that both the stressful virtual environment, where participants were hanging suspended over a city, and the social virtual environment where participants were audibly encouraged in a stadium, increased participants’ persistence in both exercises, when compared to the relaxing virtual environment. Specifically, the relaxing sunny beach environment caused poorer performances in a dead hang exercise among men (n = 30), and poorer performances in a core exercise among women (n = 66). Somewhat paradoxically, this relaxing virtual beach environment was considered the most enjoyable environment among both male and female participants. The potential of VR in exercise lies in its ability to provide pleasurable and performance-enhancing immersive environments that may be too expensive or dangerous in reality. © 2023 The Author","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166335280"

However, the literature about the use of video-based preoperative information technique for anxiety reduction in that age group still remains understudied with conflicting results. We hypothesized that there would be no meaningful difference in anxiety score at induction period between the information-based video versus self-selected video distraction technique. Methods: Eighty-two children between 6 and 12 years undergoing surgery were randomized to self-selected video (n = 41) and information-based video (n = 41) distraction group in this prospective, randomized, noninferiority trial. Children in self-selected video group were shown video of their choice using smart phones, while children in the information-based video group were shown video of operation theater (OT) set up and induction procedure. The children were taken inside operating room along with parents watching the respective videos. Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (m-YPAS), just before induction of anesthesia was recorded as the primary outcome. Induction compliance checklist score, anxiety of the parents, and short-term postoperative outcomes in 15 days (telephonically) were recorded as secondary outcomes. Results: The mean difference in the baseline mYPAS score (95% CI) between the two groups was −2.7 (−8.2 to 2.8, p =.33) and −6.39 (−12.74 to −0.44, p =.05) just before the induction period. The upper bound of the 95% CI did not cross the value of 8, which was the noninferiority margin decided prior to study commencement. 70.73% cases had perfect induction in the self-selected video distraction group, compared to 68.29% in the information-based video group. After 15 days of postoperative follow-up, participants in the self-selected video group had a larger proportion of negative outcomes (53.7%) compared to information-based video group (31.7%), p =.044. Conclusion: Information-based technique using smart phone is non inferior to self-selected video-based distraction-based technique in decreasing PA with an additional advantage of decreasing postoperative short-term negative outcomes.

However, variable lymphatic drainage can complicate SLN detection when using Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) or lymphoscintigraphy. Virtual Reality (VR) can contribute to pre-operative planning by simulating a realistic 3D model, which improves orientation. VR can also facilitate real-patient training outside the operating room. This study explored using a VR platform for pre-operative planning in head and neck skin cancer patients undergoing SLNBs and assessed its value for residential training. Materials and methods: In this prospective technology pilot study, attending surgeons and residents who performed 21 SLNB operations on patients with head and neck skin cancers (81% males, mean age 69.2 ± 11.3) used a VR simulation model based on each patient's pre-operative SPECT scan to examine patient-specific anatomy. After surgery, they completed a questionnaire on the efficiency of the VR simulation as a pre-operative planning tool and training device for residents. Results: The attending surgeons rated the VR model's accuracy at 8.3 ± 1.6 out of 10. Three-quarters (76%) of residents reported increased confidence after using VR. The physicians rated the platform's contribution to residents' training at 7.4 ± 2.1 to 8.9 ± 1.3 out of 10. Conclusion: A VR SLNB simulation can accurately portray marked sentinel lymph nodes.

However, limited research has been conducted to study the design potential of chroma and brightness colour attributes of immersive VR environments. This study investigates the impacts of colour attributes on cognitive performance and intellectual abilities in immersive Virtual Reality (VR) Environments. The paper included the results of two psychological experiments that evaluate people's cognitive performance to different chroma and brightness, respectively. The experiments further studied effects of colour attributes on participants' logical and lateral thinking abilities, as well as their attention to details. Participants' response time and error rate when completing each psychometric test were recorded with different hue, chroma, and brightness backgrounds in immersive virtual environments. The data collected from participants reveal the differential impacts of colour attributes on people's cognitive performance and intellectual abilities in immersive VR environments.

We propose the concept of embodied provenance, the use of three-dimensional space and embodied interactions in supporting recalling, reproducing, annotating and sharing analysis history in immersive environments. We design a conceptual framework for embodied provenance by highlighting a set of design criteria for analytic provenance drawn from prior work and identifying essential properties for embodied provenance. We develop a prototype system in virtual reality to demonstrate the concept and support the conceptual framework by providing multiple data views and embodied interaction metaphors in a large virtual space. We present a use case scenario of energy consumption analysis and evaluated the system through a qualitative evaluation with 17 participants, which show the system's potential for assisting analytic provenance using embodiment.

Current approaches for optimizing RMLs' placement at intersections work in hypothetical environments which do not well reflect real-world situations. This article proposes a new virtual method (VM) for optimizing the deployment of RMLs at as-built intersections. The proposed VM operates in a virtual environment where both static background and dynamic agents are modeled by dense point clouds. The agents are driven by real-world motion data. Using RMLs' parameters as inputs, a coarse-to-fine subsampling approach is developed to generate laser scans in the virtual world. An objective function is then defined by comparing the agents' points in the generated laser scan sequences against their original models. Bayesian optimization is applied to maximize the objective function by setting the RMLs' positions and poses as decision variables. Besides, batch processing strategy and parallel computing are used to accelerate the optimization process. The effectiveness of the proposed VM is demonstrated in a case study. The VM shall help road administrators make decisions on RMLs' deployment at as-built intersections. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163460226"

This compels the industries to make a leap from accurate colour reproduction to accurate appearance reproduction where information of gloss, translucency and texture are to be tackled. ICC colour management has been concerned with diffuse geometry colour reproduction without considering other appearance factors. With the new colour management architecture, iccMAX, it is now possible to create colour management workflows that include appearance information in ICC profiles. ICC profiles can either include appearance information that can be used by 3D rendering systems or render a material surface output itself using this information. Although colour management support for rendering material appearance has been provided by including tags for bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) to be utilised in ICC profiles, there are not many workflows that are using these developing technologies. Therefore, it is now of interest to look into standardising material appearance workflows through colour management for these technologies. In this chapter, we discuss how material appearance can be rendered for opaque surfaces, explore provisions made in iccMAX to support appearance rendering and then introduce a simple rendering solution using an iccMAx workflow. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The research questions included identifying key findings from studies on student privacy. The researchers followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology and completed three rounds of searching for studies, including general searches in Academic Search Complete and Education Research Complete and a targeted search using Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria for the studies were as follows: empirical data on privacy from students' perspectives, higher education setting and published in a top 10 educational technology journal. Once the articles were identified, they were screened and coded independently by two reviewers, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus. A narrative synthesis outlined three key themes from the original studies: privacy comforts, privacy concerns and privacy compromises. The study concluded with a discussion of the current state of knowledge of student privacy in online, hybrid and technology-enhanced courses, highlighting the need for greater focus on the balance of students' privacy and technology integration in higher education. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Integration of technology in higher education can pose student privacy concerns. Aspects of online and technology-supported courses can potentially compromise student privacy. Personal information collected or shared without consent can be an issue. Digital tools and platforms used in online and hybrid courses can be associated with privacy risks. Learning management systems, online exams, virtual simulations and immersive virtual reality can pose privacy risks for students. Previous syntheses have explored technology in higher education but not from the students' perspectives across various course formats. What this paper adds This systematic review provides information about students' perspectives on privacy in online, hybrid and technology-enhanced courses. It offers a comprehensive analysis of key findings from studies on student privacy, including privacy comforts, concerns and compromises. It shares insight into how students perceive privacy concerns in online, hybrid and technology-supported learning and how these concerns might be addressed. It emphasizes the need for greater attention to the balance of students' privacy and technology integration in higher education. Implications for practice and/or policy The findings of this paper have important implications for policy and practice in higher education. Institutions should provide clear guidelines and policies on data privacy and security in online, hybrid and technology-supported learning environments, including transparent information on data collection, storage and usage. Institutions should prioritize the use of secure platforms and tools that protect students' data and privacy. Involving students in decision-making around technology integration and privacy policies can provide valuable insights and help develop policies that are responsive to their needs. Institutions should provide training and support to students focused on digital literacy and data privacy to empower them to take ownership of their privacy and security in online and technology-supported learning environments. © 2023 British Educational Research Association.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165157151"

For office activities, users frequently require planar input methods, such as typing or handwriting, to quickly record annotations to virtual content. However, current off-The-shelf VR HMD setups rely on mid-Air interactions, which can cause arm fatigue and decrease input accuracy. To address this issue, we propose UbiSurface, a robotic touch surface that can automatically reposition itself to physically present a virtual planar input surface (VR whiteboard, VR canvas, etc.) to users and to permit them to achieve accurate and fatigue-less input while walking around a virtual room. We design and implement a prototype of UbiSurface that can dynamically change a canvas-sized touch surface's position, height, and pitch and yaw angles to adapt to virtual surfaces spatially arranged at various locations and angles around a virtual room. We then conduct studies to validate its technical performance and examine how UbiSurface facilitates the user's primary mid-Air planar interactions, such as painting and writing in a room-scale VR setup. Our results indicate that this system reduces arm fatigue and increases input accuracy, especially for writing tasks. We then discuss the potential benefits and challenges of robotic touch devices for future room-scale VR setups.  © 2023 Owner/Author.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177580783"

Situating ROIS as a joint cognitive system, this model consists of five categories of qualitative factors: 1) general design approach; 2) topological relationships; 3) features of tasks; 4) hardware-specific design modalities; and 5) interactive qualities. We probe the comprehensiveness of this model using existing design scenarios at the CRAIVE-Lab and the CIR featuring both application-based and experience-based designs. Through these case studies, the robustness of this model in its representation of design intention is observed, with limitations on temporal constraints.

By immersing someone in a new computer-generated reality, it is possible to create realistic, safe, and controllable simulations for research and training, as well as new three-dimensional-enriched consumer experiences and services. Most of these environments, especially in the metaverse, rely on virtual representations of people called avatars. The design and non-verbal behaviors of these avatars must be carefully crafted to provide a realistic and truly immersive experience. This paper aims to understand how avatar nonverbal behaviors (i.e., body posture, facial expression, and head movement) are perceived by users immersed in a virtual reality context, a very common situation encountered in many simulations and especially during training. Therefore, the first objective of this study is to validate, through an experiment with 125 participants, how the audience's levels of emotional valence and arousal are perceived in virtual reality. Based on these results, a library of audience non-verbal behaviors corresponding to different arousal and valence levels is now available for future applications. The experiment also examines the benefits of using low-end versus high-end virtual reality headsets, and photo-realistic versus cartoon avatars.

The simulation experiment analysis suggests that the DBA algorithm takes the balance of travel distance into account and effectively improves task quality. The Utility Function in B-DBA and the Biological Heuristic Search Algorithm in Pareto Ant Colony Optimization play a critically important role in enhancing the overall task quality. In addition, a Transmission based on Privacy Protection (TPP) algorithm is designed to protect the attribute-based privacy information in the traffic information transmission system. This algorithm ensures that the real-time traffic information processing system resists various attacks from malicious nodes. It has been verified that when the number of selfish nodes accounts for 30%, the transmission efficiency of the TPP algorithm reaches 0.77.

Methods: Patients were retrospectively identified who underwent complex oncologic resections whose operations differed from preoperative plans between April 2018 and April 2019. Virtual reality modeling was performed based on preoperative 2D images to assess feasibility of use of this technology to create models. Preoperative plans made based upon 2D imaging versus VRM were compared to the final operations performed. Once the use of VRM to create preoperative plans was deemed feasible, individuals undergoing complex oncologic resections whose operative plans were difficult to define preoperatively were enrolled prospectively from July 2019 to December 2021. Preoperative plans made based upon 2D imaging and VRM by both the operating surgeon and a consulting surgeon were compared to the operation performed. Confidence in each operative plan was also measured. Results: Twenty patients were identified, seven retrospective and 13 prospective, with tumors of the liver, pancreas, retroperitoneum, stomach, and soft tissue. Retrospectively, VRM were unable to be created in one patient due to a poor quality 2D image; the remainder (86%) were successfully able to be created and examined. Virtual reality modeling more clearly defined the extent of resection in 50% of successful cases. Prospectively, all VRM were successfully performed. The concordance of the operative plan with VRM was higher than with 2D imaging (92% versus 54% for the operating surgeon and 69% versus 23% for the consulting surgeon). Confidence in the operative plan after VRM compared to 2D imaging also increased for both surgeons (by 15% and 8% for the operating and consulting surgeons, respectively). Conclusions: Virtual reality modeling is feasible and may improve preoperative planning compared to 2D imaging. Further investigation is warranted. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166656349"

Virtual Reality (VR) offers an efficient tool for modulating public speaking anxiety through a wide range of customizations concerning environmental settings. However, scientific research needs to understand better what features of the simulated environment are more important to increase or reduce participants’ perceived discomfort. The present study investigates the role of visual (human vs cartoon characters) and acoustic (human vs robotic voice) audience features on perceived anxiety, sense of presence, and perceived realism in an interactive VR public speaking scenario. 42 participants (mean age = 24 y.o; Females = 30) performed four public speaking sessions, characterized by different levels (high vs. low) of graphic and acoustic audience design. Both explicit (questionnaires) and implicit physiological measures (Electrodermal activity-EDA) collected during audience interaction were used to assess the participants’ experiences. The results showed that the features of the simulated audience played a crucial role in perceived anxiety during a virtual public speaking. Specifically, the more realistic level of graphic and acoustic stimuli resulted in higher levels of self-reported anxiety as compared to the lower realism level. However, the experienced realism and the sense of presence seem more affected by the graphical than acoustic features of the virtual environment. By contrast, the acoustic features impact on the interaction realism with the virtual audience. Interestingly, the robotic voice (lower acoustic realism) increased electrodermal response during the interaction with the audience, interpreted as a break in the sense of presence. A positive correlation between anxiety, sense of presence, and experienced realism was found. As well, perceived anxiety is correlated with electrodermal activity during the performance. Nevertheless, physiological activity is more affected by the first experience than the realism features, suggesting the presence of a habituation effect across the repeated sessions. Taken together, the results of our study showed that multisensory features (graphical and acoustic) of the virtual environment play a fundamental role in creating realistic public speaking experiences and might be used within gamification strategies for soft skill training (e.g., for improving public speaking anxiety). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166481250"

Several deep learning architectures applied to these matrix learning methods have recently been proposed in classification tasks by learning discriminative Euclidean-based embeddings. In this paper, we propose a new Riemannian-based deep learning network to generate more discriminative features for electroencephalogram (EEG) classification. Our key innovation lies in learning the Riemannian barycenter for each class within a Riemannian geometric space. The proposed model normalizes the distribution of SPD matrices and learns the center of each class to penalize the distances between the matrix and the corresponding class centers. As a result, our framework can further simultaneously reduce the intra-class distances, enlarge the inter-class distances for the learned features, and consistently outperform other state-of-the-art methods on three widely used EEG datasets and the data from our stress-induced experiment in virtual reality. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework for learning the non-stationary nature of EEG signals due to the robustness of the covariance descriptor and the benefits of considering the barycenters on the Riemannian geometry. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161631553"

The development of haptic virtual reality (VR) dental trainers provides a platform where irreversible procedures can be safely and unlimitedly practised. The aim of this study was to assess the educational implementation of these devices and evaluate schools' satisfaction. Methods: Dental schools that were using haptic VR dental trainers, were approached. The Dental Trainer User Inventory (DTUI), addressing the educational implementation and users' satisfaction, was developed and distributed. Results: Twenty-seven schools completed the DTUI. The total number of VR dental trainers available varied from one to 42 devices with a mean of 7 devices. The dental trainer was mostly made available from the first year (63.0%) of the undergraduate program, but it was mostly integrated into the curriculum by the third year (70.4%). Curricular integration was reported by 18 schools (66.7%), while nine schools (33.3%) indicated that they had not yet achieved integration. Twenty-one schools (69.4%) were ‘satisfied’ or ‘very satisfied’ with the devices, while two schools (7.4%) were dissatisfied and six schools (22.2%) were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. Conclusion: VR haptic dental trainers are implemented in multiple dental programs and are also being used for educational research and clinical training. Even though curricular changes and teachers' acceptance remain a challenge, most schools are satisfied with VR haptic dental trainers and would recommend the device to other schools. © 2022 The Authors.

Inhalation of toxic gases and chemical irritants during the fire leads to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Breathing exercises are painful but are needed to help counteract contractures and increase lung capacity. These patients are usually in pain and extremely anxious about chest physiotherapy. Virtual reality distraction is one such technique that is gaining immense popularity when compared to other pain distraction techniques. However, studies examining the efficacy of the virtual reality distraction technique in this population are lacking. Objectives: To find and compare the effects of the virtual reality distraction technique as a pain alleviation tool for reducing pain during chest physiotherapy in chest burns patients with ARDS in middle-aged adults. Methods: A randomized controlled study was conducted at the physiotherapy department between 1st Sep 2020 and 30th Dec 2022. The eligible sixty subjects were randomized into two groups: The virtual reality distraction group (n = 30) received virtual reality distraction technique and the control group (n = 30) received progressive relaxation technique before chest physiotherapy as a pain distraction technique. All the participants received chest physiotherapy as a common treatment (treatment as usual). Primary (Visual Analogue Scale – VAS) and secondary (forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, peak expiratory flow (PEF), residual volume (RV), functional residual capacity (FRC), total lung capacity (TLC), RV/TLC, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of the lungs (DLCO) outcome measures were measured at baseline, after four weeks, eight weeks and at six months follow up. The effects between the two groups were analyzed using the independent t-test and chi-square test. The intra-group effect was analyzed with a repeated measure ANOVA test. Results: Baseline demographic characters and study variables show homogenous distribution between the groups (p > 0.05). Four weeks following two different training protocols virtual reality distraction group shows more significant changes in pain intensity, FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, PEF, RV, FRC, TLC, RV/TLC, and DLCO (p = 0.001) but not in RV (p = 0.541). The similar improvements were noted in the 8 weeks and 6 months follow up. Conclusion: The reports of the study concluded that virtual reality distraction is an effective and useful technique in reducing pain and increasing lung capacity in chest burn patient with ARDS following smoke inhalation in community-dwelling middle-aged adults. In the virtual reality distraction group, the patients reported significantly less pain and clinically meaningful changes in pulmonary functions as compared to the control group (physiotherapy + relaxation). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd and International Society of Burns Injuries","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163284353"

The pain felt during the injection causes most patients to experience significant stress for further injections, the level of which is variable between patients. Immersive virtual reality is a digital technique that simulates the three-dimensional spatial and sound environment around a person said to be immersed in this virtualised world. The effectiveness of virtual reality comes from the intensity of this multisensory immersion, known as the feeling of presence (ie, subjective experience of being in one place or one environment, even when you are physically in another one). Only one research article in paediatrics has shown that immersive reality technique has a positive impact on the level of pain and agitation suffered during botulinum toxin injections. The purpose of this study is therefore to evaluate with sufficient assurance the following research hypothesis: virtual reality can help adults cope with the stress and pain of botulinum toxin treatment injection. Methods and analysis The research hypothesis will be tested using a randomised stepped-wedge method versus a non-invasive technique (headset with virtual reality session) to its control (headset with no image nor audio). The design leads to considering the injection as a statistical unit as all participants will undergo the standard condition, the control technique and virtual reality technique.

Emerging evidence suggests that incorporating gaming interfaces (also referred to as “exergames”), including virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR)-based interfaces for motor training, can enhance the engagement and efficacy of poststroke rehabilitation. Objective: To investigate perceptions of individuals with stroke regarding technology and exergames for rehabilitation. Design: This qualitative phenomenological study included a convenience sample of 11 individuals with stroke (61.7 ± 12.4 years, 6 women and 5 men, 63.5 ± 41.2 months post stroke). Setting: Community. Interventions: N/A. Outcome Measures: Semistructured open-ended focus-group interviews to understand their perceptions on technology and exergames to improve recovery were coded using thematic content analysis. Results: Individuals with stroke were comfortable using smartphones, computers, and rehabilitation technologies but had limited experiences using exergames and VR/AR devices. Individuals with stroke were motivated to use technologies and exergames to improve their functional recovery. Participants identified facilitators (eg, enhancing functional recovery, feedback, therapist supervision) and barriers (eg, safety, inaccessibility, inadequate knowledge) to adopting exergames in their daily lives. Participants wanted the exergames to be customizable, goal oriented, and enjoyable to maintain their engagement. They were willing to use exergames to improve their functional recovery but indicated that these games could not replace the therapist's supervision. Conclusions: Despite having limited experiences with exergames, people post stroke perceived that exergames could promote functional recovery.

Background: Many of the incidents in high-risk industries are the result of issues with procedures (e.g., standard operating procedures; SOPs) workers use to support their performance. HSs in these procedures are meant to communicate potential work hazards and methods of mitigating those hazards. However, there is little empirical research regarding whether current hazard design guidelines for consumer products translate to procedures. Method: Two experimental studies—(1) a laboratory study and (2) a high-fidelity simulation—manipulated the HS design elements present in procedures participants used while performing tasks. Participants’ adherence to the mitigation of the hazard was compared for the HS designs. Results: The guidelines for HSs from consumer products did not translate to procedures. Specifically, the presence of an alert icon, a box around the statement, and highlighting the statement did not improve adherence to HSs. Indeed, the only consistent finding was for the Icon, with its presence reliably predicting nonadherence in both studies. Additionally, the total number of design elements did not have a positive effect on adherence. Conclusion: These findings indicate that more fundamental procedure HSs research is needed to identify effective designs as well as to understand the potential attentional mechanisms associated with these findings. Application: The findings from these studies indicate that current regulations and guidelines should be revisited regarding hazard presentation in procedures. © Copyright 2021, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120769689"

Often, training programs use conventional methods, such as classroom or video lectures. However, with these methods, trainees are passive and can quickly lose their attention, thus making the safety training ineffective. Alternatively, a virtual reality (VR) serious game can be used as a hands-on training tool to motivate and engage trainees. Relevant situations are simulated in a virtual environment where trainees can learn safety concepts and awareness without causing real harm to themselves or others. The current study investigates person-centred variables: motivation and engagement. We measured how safety motivation and engagement changed with employees of a chemical company when playing the VR LaboSafe Game after a traditional video lecture. Results show that employees have a high autonomous motivation to follow safety training, particularly in terms of identified regulation. Playing the VR serious game significantly increased intrinsic motivation and engagement of the trainees. They believe that they are more active, can keep their attention better and enjoy the experience of relevant situations in a virtual environment. However, complicated usability and the unfamiliarity to VR can affect their autonomous motivation for safety training. Older employees (above 50) have more difficulties with using VR headsets than younger employees (under 30). Data suggest to combine conventional methods with VR as complementary tool and provide more frequent and smaller sessions, gradually introducing VR technology to beginners. © 2023","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166487998"

NVEs aim to give distributed users a feeling of immersion in a virtual world and the possibility of interacting with other users or with virtual objects inside it, just like when they interact in the real world. Being able to provide that feeling and natural interactions when the users are geographically separated is one of the goals of these systems. Nevertheless, this goal is especially sensitive to different issues, such as different connections with heterogeneous throughput or particular network latencies, which can lead to consistency and synchronization problems and, thus, to a worsening of the users’ quality of experience or QoE. With the purpose of solving these issues, researchers have proposed and evaluated numerous technical solutions, in fields like network architectures, data distribution and filtering, resource balancing, computing models, predictive modeling and synchronization in NVEs.

We combined duality theories and the technology-enabled engagement process model to establish that a VR/PIC preview enhances consumers’ appraisal and their intention to patronize P2P accommodations through cognitive and affective engagement. Furthermore, the VR/PIC preview’s effect on patronage intention was found to be influenced by the motivation for consumer reservation: consumers form a positive appraisal when the target accommodation type (comfortable vs. economical) matches the preview mode (PIC vs. VR).

To facilitate working with a large database containing many patients and parameters, we propose a virtual data shelf, displaying the 3D anatomical surface models in an immersive VR environment. Methods: Thereby, different functionalities such as sorting, filtering and finding similar cases are included. To provide an appropriate layout and arrangement of 3D models that optimally supports working with the database, three layouts (flat, curved and spherical) and two distances are evaluated. A broad audience study with 61 participants was conducted to compare the different layouts based on their ease of interaction, to get an overview and to explore single cases. Medical experts additionally evaluated medical use cases. Results: The study revealed that the flat layout with small distance is significantly faster in providing an overview. Applying the virtual data shelf to the medical use case intracranial aneurysms, qualitative expert feedback with two neuroradiologists and two neurosurgeons was gathered. Most of the surgeons preferred the curved and spherical layouts. Conclusion: Our tool combines benefits of two data management metaphors, resulting in an efficient way to work with a large database of 3D models in VR. The evaluation gives insight into benefits of layouts as well as possible use cases in medical research. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149232749"

However, those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and exposure to moral injury (MI) may exhibit altered theory-of-mind (ToM)/mentalizing processes and experience shame which precludes one's capacity for direct eye contact. We investigated blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses associated with direct vs averted gaze using a virtual reality paradigm in individuals with PTSD (n = 28) relative to healthy controls (n = 18) following recall of a MI vs a neutral memory. Associations between BOLD responses and clinical symptomatology were also assessed. After MI recall, individuals with PTSD showed greater activation in the right temporoparietal junction as compared to controls (T = 4.83; pFDR < 0.001; k = 237) during direct gaze. No significant activation occurred during direct gaze after neutral memory recall. Further, a significant positive correlation was found between feelings of distress and right medial superior frontal gyrus activation in individuals with PTSD (T = 5.03; pFDR = 0.049; k = 123). These findings suggest that direct gaze after MI recall prompts compensatory ToM/mentalizing processing.

Embedding schemes are affected by many factors, such as the topology of Network Service Requests (NSRs), the demands of NSRs on Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) computing power, and network link quality. However, most researches focus on improving the performance and algorithms of embedding SFCs, and the effect of the above factors has yet to be intensively studied. Studying the influence of the above factors can not only guide users to initiate more suitable NSRs but also have guiding significance for scheduling network resources. Due to the subgraph isomorphism that can quickly find all feasible solutions, it is applied to embedding SFCs to explore the influence of the above factors on embedding SFC. However, subgraph isomorphism in large-scale networks is inefficient due to its high computational complexity. We propose an adaptive adjustment strategy to prune the network to reduce the computational complexity of subgraph isomorphism. Simulation results show that the subgraph isomorphism can search all feasible embedding schemes quickly and observe the influence of the above factors on embedding schemes. Those factors significantly impact embedding SFCs, mainly reflected in scheme numbers and latency performance.  © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149417473"

The approach is based on the virtual pendulum concept observed in human and animal locomotion experiments, which redirects ground reaction forces to a virtual support point called the Virtual Pivot Point (VPP) during the stance phase. Using the hybrid averaging theorem, we prove the upright posture stability of bipedal running with a fixed VPP position and propose a VPP angle feedback controller for online VPP adjustment to improve performance and convergence speed. Additionally, we present the first application of the VPP concept to quadrupedal posture control and design a VPP position feedback control law to enhance robustness in quadrupedal bounding. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed VPP-based controllers through various simulations, demonstrating their effectiveness in posture control of both bipedal running and quadrupedal bounding. The performance of the VPP-based control approach is further validated through experimental validation on a quadruped robot, SCIT Dog, for stable bounding motion generation at different forward speeds. © 2023, Jilin University.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164111331"

Furthermore, some emerging delay-sensitive applications in the IoT, such as Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and autonomous driving, require better reliability and stability. Digital twins (DT) can provide real-time and stable wireless connectivity for heterogeneous IoT physical and virtual spaces. To address those issues, we propose an adaptive caching scheme based on the evolutionary game to jointly optimize delay and energy consumption in the uplink and downlink of heterogeneous digital twins IoT (HDT-IoT) networks. Besides, we prove the existence of evolutionary stability strategies (ESSs) in the proposed caching scheme. Based on the evolutionary stability analysis results, we derive the related expression between the content popularity and the ESS condition. The numerical results verify the existence of the content evolutionary stability caching strategy and the accuracy of the derived corresponding ESS conditional expressions and evaluate the caching performance by comparing our scheme with the other two caching schemes.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161016468"

As energy healing practitioners and educators who shifted to an online format, it seemed important to document descriptions of client experiences of virtual energy healing. Objective: To describe client experiences of virtual energy healing sessions. Design: Descriptive pre-post intervention design. Setting and Interventions: Two experienced and eclectic energy healing practitioners developed a protocol and conducted energy healing sessions via Zoom. Participants: A convenience sample of Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet (CSJ) Consociates, people of diverse life-styles and spiritual traditions who are committed to living the mission of the CSJs in the St. Paul Province. Main Outcome Measures: Pre-post 10-point Likert scale rating of relaxation, well-being, and pain. Pre-post primarily qualitative questionnaires. Results: Results indicated significant pre-post differences: pre-session relaxation (M=5.036, SD = 2.9) and post-session relaxation (M=7.86, SD = 6.4): t(13)=2.16, p=.0017*; pre-session well-being (M=5.86, SD = 4.29); post-session well-being (M=8, SD = 2.31), t(13), p=.0001*; pre-session pain (M=4.0, SD = 6.15) and post-session pain (M=2.25, SD = 3.41), t(13)=2.16, p=.004*. Thematic analysis revealed six themes related to client experiences of virtual energy healing: 1) embodied sensations, 2) relaxation, 3) release - a letting go of tasks/anxieties/worries, 4) sense of peace/joy/calm, 5) connection to themselves, others, and something larger, and 6) surprise that virtual energy healing works. Limitations: This was a descriptive study using a convenience sample, therefore, there was not a control group, a large sample size, and the sample might be more prone to report better results than the general population because of their spiritual perspectives. Results were not generalizable. Implications: Clients reported positive descriptions of virtual energy healing and say they would do it again. However more research is needed to understand the variables that influenced the results and the underlying mechanisms of action. © 2023","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163618807"

Research on virtual embodied experience has connected the trends of virtualization and embodiment of experience but remains scattered and inconclusive. This systematic review of 125 peer-reviewed journal papers in the Scopus database uncovers extant work on the contextualization, conceptualization, and causal links of virtual embodied experience. It finds that extant literature neglects certain cutting-edge scenarios. Research still needs to identify more explicit dimensional structures of virtual embodied experience and more antecedents and consequences along the causal chain. Research has grounded itself in theoretical constellations across cognitive and behavioral science, sociology, and computer science. Nevertheless, flaws remain, not least the use of disembodiment-oriented theories to explain embodied experience and insufficient emphasis on the subjectivity of technology. As the lack of suitable research frameworks has presented obstacles to quantitative research, this study proposes a framework highlighting virtual embodied experience bridging virtual scenario elements (technological and environmental factors) and multiple consequences (perception, responses, and performances). This study sets out a future research agenda, including promising research directions such as exploring virtual embodied experiences in multiple virtual scenarios, clarifying its dimensional structures, and underlining the complexity of how it mediates virtual scenario elements and commercial consequences and how it leads to possible negative consequences. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166915679"

Nonetheless, little research has been done on how individuals self-perception within VR affects their performance. This self-awareness is carried out using avatars that depict the virtual body through multiple points of view. This article assessed three different conditions of virtual body within a design exercise to better understand how these affected idea generations and spatial skills. To do so, an embodiment-cognition framework to evaluate the influence of the virtual body in immersive VR environments was developed. The designed theoretical framework relies on the concept of embodiment and its relevance to situated cognition. Research has supported how cognition connects the mind and body and the relevance of the individual's interaction with its surroundings to make it meaningful. Likewise, more immersive environments can increase the sensation of presence in VR, allowing individuals to behave more naturally. Also, through the connection with the surroundings, individuals liberate cognitive load, allowing them to relocate cognitive efforts in developing knowledge. General findings support how the use of a more embodied virtual body can elicit higher levels of presence but also increase cognitive load which can ultimately hinder cognition. However, VR interactions aided participants to develop spatial skills and allowed idea generation. Furthermore, the framework proposed can be applied to assess students' cognitive processes beyond the discipline’s boundaries. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143139430"

The use of VR head-mounted displays in combination with physiological measures such as EEG presents new challenges and raises the question whether established findings also generalize to a VR setup. Here, we used a VR headset to assess the spatial constraints underlying two well-established EEG correlates of visual short-term memory: the amplitude of the contralateral delay activity (CDA) and the lateralization of induced alpha power during memory retention. We tested observers' visual memory in a change detection task with bilateral stimulus arrays of either two or four items while varying the horizontal eccentricity of the memory arrays (4, 9, or 14 degrees of visual angle). The CDA amplitude differed between high and low memory load at the two smaller eccentricities, but not at the largest eccentricity. Neither memory load nor eccentricity significantly influenced the observed alpha lateralization. We further fitted time-resolved spatial filters to decode memory load from the event-related potential as well as from its time-frequency decomposition. Classification performance during the retention interval was above-chance level for both approaches and did not vary significantly across eccentricities.

However, streaming 360-degree videos over cellular networks poses a challenge due to the need for ultra-low latency and high bandwidth. Although viewport adaptive streaming presents a promising solution to reduce the bandwidth requirement of 360° video, it remains challenging to predict the Field of View (FoV) due to the adverse impact of prediction errors on the user's Quality of Experience (QoE). Moreover, bitrate adaptation gets complicated due to 360 °videos and the dynamic nature of the cellular network. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an intelligent framework, termed Seer, to fully realize 360 ° video streaming over cellular networks by leveraging Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC). It incorporates an FoV prediction scheme and a bitrate adaptation policy into the MEC platform. In particular, the FoV prediction scheme uses perceived video features coupled with time-series based viewport prediction to achieve higher prediction accuracy. For an effective bitrate selection in cellular network conditions, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based bitrate adaptation policy is further employed. The results demonstrate that Seer's FoV prediction scheme delivers higher prediction accuracy, while the streaming framework significantly reduces the bandwidth requirements and improves the user's QoE.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151359414"

The limiting step remains the laryngeal anesthesia whose quality can influence patients’ and operators’ comfort. Methods: We propose to dye the lidocaine with methylene blue and do an instillation through a catheter introduced in the video-endoscope’s operating channel, which permits a progressive anesthesia focused on the larynx, avoiding an unwanted pharyngeal anesthesia and any tracheal irritation. Conclusion: Using blue-dyed lidocaine can help reduce the volume of anesthesia required for an office-based laryngology intervention, improving patients’ and surgeon’s comfort and reducing anesthesia’s side effects.

We aimed at exploring the possibilities of motivating, fascinating, and experiential elements of virtual reality (VR) in a collaborative learning context, with a focus on emotional contagion. We adopted the eSports mode as a competency development strategy in collaborative learning, using VR to evaluate emotional contagion that is invoked between the presenters and spectators. For this purpose, we created a VR application (HHVR) that allows freshmen students to learn about the premises and academic life at a university. We then divided 43 adult participants into presenters (N = 9) and spectators (N = 34); the presenters experienced the HHVR application first-hand, whereas the spectators watched the experience through a monitor. We used a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews to measure what feelings of being — existential feelings that affect the way we react to the world — the participants experienced. The collected data were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis and qualitative data coding and the results revealed emotional contagion; the spectators who followed the presenters on a monitor showed similar emotional engagement with the presenters who used the application. In conclusion, the proposed eSports mode can be a useful pedagogical technique in the context of collaborative learning with VR, as it engages emotionally both the presenters and spectators. These findings can be helpful for designing emotionally engaging collaborative learning experiences with VR and for conducting group-based UX evaluations of VR applications. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153705989"

This is primarily because at time of organ allocation, HLA typing is provided at antigen level whereas solid phase assays provide allele level antibody definition. The gold standard for HLA allele typing is next generation sequencing (NGS), however time limitations with established NGS systems prevent NGS use for deceased donors. Instead, many labs use a real-time PCR (qPCR) antigen level result for deceased donors, which can disadvantage sensitised patients. Here, we compared assigning qPCR 2-field alleles to qPCR antigen level to determine the impact on virtual crossmatch (VXM) and discuss impact on donor-specific antibody (DSA) assignments. 244 consecutive deceased donors were HLA typed to allelic level by qPCR (LinkSeq SABR) and subsequently by NGS (One Lambda Alltype). The impact of qPCR allele assignments on potential DSA identification was investigated, by retrospectively investigating all 3904 VXMs, where recipient DSA assessments were assessed against donor HLA, was performed within the cohort. There was 96.3% concordance between qPCR and NGS for all allele level loci, with HLA-A; DQB1; and DPB1 having best agreement (99.4%, 98.4% and 99.4% respectively). Of the 3904 VXMs with qPCR allele assignment, there were 13 (<1%) occasions where the potential DSA assignment was impacted, with DQA1 having the most impact. Assigning alleles derived from qPCR to define unacceptable antigens for VXMs, can allow improved access to donor offers for sensitised patients by better defining alleles. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The current research aimed to investigate whether a brief (20-min) pre-competition mindfulness meditation (MM) intervention enhances athletes' attentional control during competitions and alters the activity of brain regions related to attentional control. We created a virtual reality shooting competition to compare the eye-gaze indicators and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) parameters of 78 university athletes after 20 min of MM or 20 min of mind wandering (MW). Participants’ average fixation durations (AFDs) on task-relevant information (targets) were significantly longer in the MM group. In contrast, both average fixation counts (AFCs) and AFDs on task-irrelevant information (the ranking screen) were significantly lower in the MM group than in the MW group. Additionally, the MM group exhibited significantly stronger activation of the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as well as higher levels of oxygenated haemoglobin [HbO] and greater functional connectivity (FC) of the right dlPFC, which was considered evidence of recruitment for attentional control. Moreover, the MM group achieved significantly better shooting performance than the MW group. Overall, the findings suggest that one session 20-min MM practice pre-competition facilitates focus during competition and improves athletic performance.

The combination of heat denaturation and enzyme cocktails essential is found for robust cell wall digestion and expansion of microbial cells and infected tissues without distortion. µMagnify efficiently retains biomolecules suitable for high-plex fluorescence imaging with nanoscale precision. It demonstrates up to eightfold expansion with µMagnify on a broad range of pathogen-containing specimens, including bacterial and fungal biofilms, infected culture cells, fungus-infected mouse tone, and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human cornea infected by various pathogens. Additionally, an associated virtual reality tool is developed to facilitate the visualization and navigation of complex 3D images generated by this method in an immersive environment allowing collaborative exploration among researchers worldwide. µMagnify is a valuable imaging platform for studying how microbes interact with their host systems and enables the development of new diagnosis strategies against infectious diseases. © 2023 The Authors.

To investigate the influence of indicators on mixture stability, structures with diverse characteristics of aggregate contacts are required. This study proposes an algorithm for the virtual modeling of asphalt mixture beams, which supports the density and distributional controls of aggregate contacts in the microstructure. The methodology comprises three main steps: (1) three-dimensional models of coarse aggregates conforming to the predefined gradation and volumetric content are randomly selected from a digital library of realistic aggregates, (2) contact relations of aggregates are established during the adaptive arrangement of aggregates in samples with prescribed control parameters of aggregate contact using self-developed codes, and (3) air voids are randomly scattered in the sample without overlapping aggregates according to the volumetric content of the air voids, and an asphalt mortar model is then constructed using Boolean operations. Four beam samples with different contact characteristics were obtained using the proposed method to conduct simulations of three-point bending tests. The number and spatial distribution of aggregate contacts in beam models are consistent with the prescribed parameters, showing the reliability of the proposed method for the control of aggregate contact in asphalt mixtures. A comprehensive comparison of the results of the laboratory test and simulations validates the ability of the digital beam to capture the macroscale response of asphalt mixtures. Furthermore, simulation results indicate that the sample with the greatest number and distribution uniformity of aggregate contacts has the largest peak strength and fracture energy, which is beneficial for the understanding of the relationship between the indicators of aggregate contacts and the rutting and fatigue resistance of mixtures. © 2023 The Authors.

The cloud–edge-end collaborative offloading further addresses the problem of insufficient computing resources of edge servers owing to large-scale computing-intensive applications in MEC. However, existing offloading solutions often ignore the important factor of economic cost, making it hard for these solutions to achieve a sustainable cloud–edge-end collaborative computation. To this end, this paper considers a multi-user multi-server, cloud–edge-end collaborative offloading scenario in the presence of dependent offloading tasks for the sake of maximizing rewards and minimizing latency. Each user issues a computing-intensive application consisting of multiple dependent tasks, which are offloaded collaboratively by various computational resources. With the goal of maximizing the yield of offloading for users and server providers, a multi-objective optimization problem of joint task offloading and execution rewards is studied. Technically, a multivariate multi-objective optimization problem with three objectives is modeled. An efficient multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm based on MOEA/D is then developed to solve the latency minimization and reward maximization problems. Extensive simulation results verify the effectiveness of the algorithm and illustrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve user offloading benefits. In addition, a scalability evaluations of our proposed algorithm is conducted for demonstrating its feasibility in large-scale task offloading scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163885228"

The ever-increasing use of virtualization technologies makes the usage of haptic communication even more important in order to create robust tangible systems, but also to achieve an optimal and faster balance among the interaction modalities, as well as between humans and machines. The current wireless mobile networks cannot provide ultra-low latency, massive computational capability, and high communication bandwidth, requirements that are crucial for applications, such as XR and TI.

To enhance the benefits of online laboratories and also improve user experience, a novel system that is constructed based on front-end and back-end separation has been explored in this paper, which is scalable with a complex four-tier architecture supporting both remote and virtual experiments. A concurrent scheme that allows many users to conduct real-time interactive experiments with a single test rig has been implemented. The new system enables massive access for virtual experimentation and saves users from booking sessions in advance or queuing. To verify the effectiveness of the system, a renewable energy system has been developed, thus, users can concurrently conduct experiments with different control algorithms and monitoring interfaces for research and education purposes. A scalability test was conducted, the results of which showed that 94.67% of 300 users can concurrently access the same virtual laboratory, proving the scalability and concurrency features of the proposed system. The system demonstrated a throughput of 499.4 requests per second without errors during a 30-second performance test with 1600 concurrent users, where each user established 10 connections. © 2023","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162140334"

However, limited research has been conducted to understand this emerging streaming practice. To address this gap, we conducted an in-depth thematic analysis of 34 streaming videos from 12 VR streamers with varying levels of experience, to explore the current practices, interaction styles, and strategies, as well as to investigate the challenges and opportunities for VR streaming. Our findings indicate that VR streamers face challenges in building emotional connections and maintaining streaming flow due to technical problems, lack of fluid transitions between physical and virtual environments, and not intentionally designed game scenes. As a response, we propose six design implications to encourage collaboration between game designers and streaming app developers, facilitating fluid, rich, and broad interactions for an enhanced streaming experience. In addition, we discuss the use of streaming videos as user-generated data for research, highlighting the lessons learned and emphasizing the need for tools to support streaming video analysis.

However, unlike the intergroup contact literature, research on multicultural experiences has yet to examine whether the valence of these experiences may moderate such outcomes. So, could multicultural experiences actually increase intergroup bias? Five studies reveal that multicultural experiences increase (rather than decrease) intergroup bias when those experiences are negative (rather than positive). Across multiple methods (recall priming; virtual reality simulation), and experiences across multiple countries, negative multicultural experiences increased intergroup bias (stereotyping; prejudice) – both to groups associated, and stigmatized groups not associated, with the specific multicultural experience. This increased bias did not extend to ingroup members or non-human targets. The impact of negative multicultural experiences on increased bias was mediated by changes in intergroup ideologies/worldviews – specifically social dominance orientation. These findings reveal how multicultural experiences can be a double-edged sword in our increasingly globalized world. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164322744"

Objective: Describe the effectiveness and public availability of published educational tools for urogynecologic surgery. Study design: A systematic review was conducted by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from 1946 to 2023 for articles describing educational tools in urogynecology. There were no restrictions on study design or language. Data were extracted in duplicate using a standardized piloted extraction form, and outcomes were combined descriptively. Results: 2997 titles, 457 abstracts, and 97 full-text articles were analyzed. Of the 97 interventions included, 43 were manuscripts and 54 were conference abstracts. The median study quality was low, with a moderate risk of bias. Six intervention categories were identified: didactics, animal models, cadavers, static models, extended reality (XR), and multimodal workshops. Didactics were subjectively useful for teaching pelvic anatomy and diseases and improving surgical techniques. If good quality, animal models and cadavers provided visual and tactile learning and assessed performance in real-time. Animal models were also anatomically realistic and useful at half the cost of cadavers. Static models and XR improved confidence, knowledge, skills, and error rates despite lack of realism and accurate tissue texture in some models and steep learning curve with XR. Only four models were commercially accessible. Most studies did not assess long-term (>6 months) retention. Conclusion: All educational modalities for urogynecologic surgery are largely realistic and increase participant satisfaction, preparedness, knowledge, skills, and likelihood of use. But only 40% advanced to manuscripts, and even fewer (<5%) were widely available. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166397348"

When the loss and constraint functions are convex, this belongs to the general family of online convex optimization (OCO). In existing OCO works, the environment is assumed to vary in a time-slotted fashion, while the decisions are updated at each time slot. However, many wireless communication systems permit only periodic decision updates, i.e., each decision is fixed over multiple time slots, while the environment changes between the decision epochs. The standard OCO model is inadequate for these systems. Therefore, in this article, we consider periodic decision updates for OCO. We aim to minimize the accumulation of time-varying convex loss functions, subject to both short-term and long-term constraints. Feedback information about the loss functions within the current update period may be delayed and incomplete. We propose an efficient algorithm, termed Periodic Queueing and Gradient Aggregation (PQGA), which employs novel periodic queues together with possibly multi-step aggregated gradient descent to update the decisions over time. We derive upper bounds on the dynamic regret, static regret, and constraint violation of PQGA. As an example application, we study the performance of PQGA for network virtualization in a large-scale multi-antenna system shared by multiple wireless service providers. Simulation results show that PQGA converges fast and substantially outperforms the current best alternative.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135765663"

Therefore, adapting to dynamic learning settings has now become a key criterion for academic performance. The factors that we know have a detrimental effect on learners’ academic performance and cognitive capacity are related to today’s traditional learning settings, but the circumstances in interactive learning environments such as virtual reality learning environments remains uncertain. To address this gap, we aimed to investigate the circumstances in virtual reality learning environments by considering both task characteristics and multitasking, both of which have been shown to have controversial effects on cognitive load and academic performance. The research was carried out with a total of 218 participants assigned to one of four treatment groups: (1) Multitasking & Regular Task (f = 59), (2) Multitasking & Hard Task (f = 56), (3) Monotasking & Regular Task (f = 52), and (4) Monotasking & Hard Task (f = 51), all with previous experience in virtual reality learning environments. Learners’ working memory capacity and prior knowledge levels were measured as covariate variables. MANCOVA results showed significant differences across the treatment groups, in terms of achievement and retention scores. Findings not only reveal the more need for multifaceted empirical research in the field of education but also indicate that the outcomes of interactive learning environments may differ from those of traditional learning settings. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153049011"

First, we detect and segment the guitars present in the image using semantic segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks. In a second step, we perform the final 3D reconstruction of the guitar by warping the rendered depth maps of a fitted 3D template in 2D image space to match the input silhouette. We validated our method by obtaining guitar reconstructions from real input images and renders of all guitar models available in the ShapeNet database. Numerical results for different object families were obtained by computing standard mesh evaluation metrics such as Intersection over Union, Chamfer Distance, and the F-score.

Educators in many subjects are experimenting with incorporating this technology into their teaching processes, with the intention of creating a learning environment that their students can interact with to increase their interest in learning. VR technology with immersive learning has been highly tested and developed for use with students of art and other subjects, and positive results have been reported. In this study, we focus on students at art colleges and explore the trends in the development of immersive learning with VR technology in art and design education. Art is often identified as a subject in which high-dimensional artistic interaction is required throughout the learning process. A systematic review of the topic over the past five years was conducted with the aim of demonstrating how this technology is evolving in terms of art teaching, the types of VR technology being used, and the groups of learners that this technology can help. The results indicate that in teaching art with visual communication design, no practitioners are currently using fully immersive VR technology.
